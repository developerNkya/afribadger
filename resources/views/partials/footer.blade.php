                text: "India is one of the most overwhelming countries in the world. A place of immense beauty that will leave you with everlasting memories. Its aromas, colours, flavours, wonderful landscapes, chaotic cities and peaceful rural areas, but above all, the friendly and smiling people. Your vision of the world will not be the same after visiting this incredible country.\n\n![](image\u002F416)\n\n**Sadly, at Afribadger, we have put reservations on standby due to the terrible pandemic that affects us all, but especially India at the moment. Our hope and best wishes are with all of them, with our collaborators and with our tribes.**\n\nWe are confident that we will travel again soon, and our itineraries to India, unique and tailor-made for us, will be the experience of a lifetime for our adventurers.\n\n#### Sikkim, your next destination\n\n![](image\u002F418)\n\nBordered by China, Nepal, and Bhutan, Sikkim was a monarchy before merging with India in 1975. Today it takes pride in being the only state of this country that practices 100% organic food production. Some of the leading tribes of Sikkim are Limbu, Lepcha, and Bhutia.\n\nThe unique itineraries that you can experience with Afribadger in this small state in North East India will let you discover the daily lives of these tribes. Enjoy the delicious cuisine, local dances and music, customs and traditions, festivals, agrarian practices, religion, environment and much more.\n\nOur tours will be conducted so that they will have a positive social, economic and environmental impact, helping local communities recover from the tremendous crisis caused by the pandemic. The revenue generated from your travels will be shared directly with the local stakeholders, thus providing ongoing support and well-being. People in many local communities are trained in hospitality to provide them with an alternative income.\n\n#### Live like a local…\n\nFrom the first day of arrival in Kolkata you will live in local homes to learn about their traditions first hand. Starting with a Bengali family, you will learn the actual tricks of traditional cuisine, customs and the way of life of urban tribes.\n\n![](image\u002F420)\n\nIn the following days, travel to Bagdogra to continue your journey through the Sikkim region and meet some local tribes. With Afribadger, you can choose whether to visit the Limba and the Lepchu or the Buthia. After experiencing one itinerary, you will most likely be so in love with this place that you will want to meet the other tribes in the future.\n\n#### …with the Buthia\n\n![](image\u002F414)\n\nIf you choose to visit the Buthia, you can enjoy spending free time chatting with the community and perhaps sharing a glass of their local millet-based wine.\n\nDuring your stay, tribe members will teach you about the forest herbs and how they are used while you learn to cook a delicious dinner. You can learn about the local festivals and customs of the village.\n\nYour hosts will introduce you to other villagers and take you to remarkable Buddhist monasteries. You may even meet the Lama if he is available, who might tell you some local legends. You can visit the handicrafts centre and learn about wood carving, carpet and shawl making out of sheep wool. The handicrafts centre is an initiative by local self-help groups to provide an alternate source of living for village men and women. We will facilitate a brief interaction with the local craftspeople. The artisans can be wary of people but very friendly once they open up.\n\nSikkim is well-known as a trekking destination, so take some time to explore the landscapes with your hosts, as well as visiting the Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary, where you will see deer, fox and the rare red panda.![](image\u002F415)\n\nWithout a doubt, the most fun will be to dance the Bhutia cultural dance in a starry evening with the community families and relax with a traditional herbal bath at sunset. This is a traditional Bhutanese body healing bath where the water is prepared by soaking herbs and heating over hot stones. It is excellent for relaxing the muscles and was used by Bhutia farmers after long days working on the farms.\n\n#### …with the Limbu and Lepcha\n\n![](image\u002F413)\n\nWith your Limbu family, you will have a hands-on farming experience just the way they do. Depending upon the season, they will involve you in sowing, harvesting, or processing black cardamom, potatoes, or maize which are the main crops of this area.\n\nYou will also visit the local Shaman in the evening and learn about the local religion that worships a chief god, Niwa Buma, and mountain and river deities.\n\nDo not worry because it will be not all work, and they will also take you for a walk to visit the ruins of Rabdentse, which was the second capital of Sikkim until the Nepalese kingdoms raided it. Further, there will be time to visit the Pemayangtse monastery, where you might see the monks studying in a monastic school or the prayers in progress.\n\n#### But our itineraries to Sikkim offer you much more than that …\n\nDuring the trip, you will also have time to discover beautiful cities such as Kolkata or charming Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. Here you can enjoy the ancient markets and unforgettable landmarks. You will also have free time to relax and reflect on the feelings and learnings from your experience.\n\n![](image\u002F417)\n\nBut above all you can have the peace of mind that these itineraries are socially sustainable. Because we make sure that the homestays consistently contribute towards the sustainable development of the community. Our village experiences are based on ‘storytelling’ rather than sightseeing. We encourage the participation of women in decision making and entrepreneurship and we facilitate the interaction of our travelers with local artisans.\n\nWe also make sure these trips are environmentally friendly, making sure that the vehicles we use are compliant with the latest emission standards in India. We use recyclable materials and we encourage plastic-free trips. Wherever solar power isn’t available, we encourage energy-efficient LED lights and all the raw material we use for cooking is sourced locally.\n\n![](image\u002F421)\n\nIf you want to know more about our itineraries, visit our travel and tribes sections. There you will find all the details of these unique experiences and much more information about our ethical practices.\n\nGet ready to travel to Sikkim soon!\n\n**Afribadger team**\n\nCover photo \u002F Photo by [PRATAP CHHETRI](https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@pratap96?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fs\u002Fphotos\u002Fsikkim?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText).

                title: "Indigenous Weddings II: African Tribes",
                text: 'In this second article, included in the series in which we explain the most incredible characteristics of indigenous weddings around the world, we are going to relate some of the most surprising weddings among African tribes.\n\nAfrica is the richest continent in traditions, culture, ethnic diversity on the face of the Earth. The number of tribes that inhabit it is incalculable and, each one of them, has developed its own culture and traditions that last throughout the centuries. Today we are going to review some of the most curious weddings of these indigenous communities:\n\n#### The Maasai\n\n![](image\u002F411)\n\nMarriage in the Maasai community is conducted after initiation of the boy and girl. The marriage is arranged by elders without informing the bride and her mother. Dances are common and this is where boys and girls meet. When a boy admires a girl, he goes to his parents and the parents go to the girl’s family to ask for her hand in marriage. If the family agrees, the boy’s parents would return on the next visit with a dowry of animals like cattle, goats, sheep, bed sheets and blankets. They also take khat and sugar.\n\nDuring the marriage ceremony, a big sheep or a bull is brought from the groom’s home and slaughtered. Funny enough, the bride does not eat the meat. Another goat from the bride’s home is slaughtered for her. On the wedding day, the men stand at the gate and lift their sticks up, intersecting each other to create a gate. The best man goes through the gate first followed by the groom and his parents. The wedding clothes are the skin of cows with the red ochre applied on the skin for decoration. The shoes are also made of the skin. The bride and the groom apply the red ochre on the head for beauty. The bride’s present is milk and fat in a gourd.\n\nAfter the girl has passed the gate, the men bless her and release her to go with her husband. After a few metres, depending on the distance of the groom’s home, the bride sits down and takes three sips of the milk. In case there is stones or river on the way, she is carried by the best man until the ground is good without stones or rivers. When they reach the bride’s home, a big ceremony is conducted by the elders to welcome the couple to their home. Both the bridegroom and the bride are called for a talk on how to manage their family. They are advised on how to live a happy life together.\n\n#### The Mursi\n\n![](image\u002F409)\n\nIn the culture of the Mursi, one of the best known peoples of the Omo Valley in Ethiopia, the marriage ritual, or "gama", establishes the union of a couple. it is preceded by some rites, two male and one female, that perform the promise to marry.\n\nThe future husband must have the necessary assets to be able to pay the marriage compensation, a sort of price to be paid for the bride, which must be paid to the future wife\'s family; this payment represents an indemnity to compensate for the loss, in terms of work and fertility, caused to the relatives of the bride.\n\nBefore the wedding, the Mursi ritual foresees that the kidong ko duri ceremony is celebrated, which is a party that lasts a whole day in which people dance and sing; the songs narrate the new life and the new responsibilities that the couple will have as a consequence of the marriage, such as having children to give continuity to their descendants. At a specific time of the day all the participants in the ceremony sit in a circle and are served coffee, or "bunna"; when everyone has received the coffee, a man, a relative of the groom, sits in the center of the circle and starts talking to a woman, this is a kind of theatrical performance that narrates the marriage.\n\nThe tugha ceremony, which must be faced by the future bride, is the last of the rituals that precede the actual wedding; during this rite the bride receives the blessing of her father who thus gives her consent to the wedding. The day on which the tugha is celebrated coincides with the day on which the livestock received by the future husband as compensation is divided and assigned to the relatives of the bride who are entitled to it by descent.\n\n#### The Amazigh\n\n![](image\u002F412)\n\nThe Amazigh wedding ritual in Morocco lasts for three days and is usually performed in the desert, in a natural environment full of magic and mystery.\n\nDuring the first day, the bride and groom remain separated each one in their home, and it is the man who sends his future wife the gifts and the attire that he must wear at the wedding. The woman\'s clothing consists of a white dress, and a red hood that covers her face. That morning, relatives and friends of the spouses arrive, who accompany the bride to the house of her fiancé, playing instruments and singing as a sign of excitement.\n\nIn the afternoon of the second day, the young people have their first meeting while both families wait behind the door. After their first meeting, the women give the Berber cry and the dance and drum party begins. On the last day, the couple sacrifices a lamb and before the sun goes down, the bride reveals her face to everyone present. The couple wear tattoos on their feet and hands painted with henna.\n\n#### The Himba\n\n![](image\u002F410)\n\nMarriage in the Himba community is seen as a way of spreading wealth, and women will move to their new husband’s village after marriage.\n\nThe Himba people practice polygamy, with both men and women being allowed to have multiple partners as long as the arrangement is open and agreeable to all parties involved. Men tend to have several wives, especially if they are rich in cattle, as the animals\' ownership is passed down from mother to daughter. The more cattle a woman owns, the greater her status of her and that of her family of her.\n\nWhen men marry, the "wavymbu", a leather cap, reveals their new married status. The imposition and placement of this element is a true ritual. It is done with extreme care as it has to remain glued to the husband\'s head forever. For the Himba, having this hairstyle come undone means "bad luck" for the couple. The bride dress up in a pure leather headdress called "okor" and after the ceremony, they plaster her in butterfat ointment signifying acceptance into the family.\n\nThe "Ondjongo" dance forms the climax of Himba marriage ceremonies.

                title: "Indigenous Weddings I: Native American Tribes",
                text: "Weddings are always sacred and emotional events; they represent a vital begging of journeys, uniting people to branch their own families and Indigenous communities worldwide, have their own amazing and unique traditions when it comes to weddings from ceremony themes to vows and attire. In this article, we'll take a journey to learn about wedding traditions amongst Native American Tribes.\n\nNative American wedding ceremonies are full of rich tradition and rituals; while they may include similar elements to contemporary wedding ceremonies, they also differ significantly in some areas.\n\n#### Timings and Season\n\n![](image\u002F405)\n\nThe Native American celebrations calendar is full of meaningful ceremonies celebrating rites of passage, a commemoration of ancestral rituals, and honouring different elements of nature and life. While these events are of great importance to individual tribes, they are entirely independent of wedding celebrations. It is understood that Spring and Autumn when there is an abundance of food and natural beauty, was particularly promising. Still, weddings were not limited to this or any other season.\n\nDifferent tribes hold their wedding celebrations at other times. For instance: The Hopis traditionally started the marriage rituals on the sunrise of the chosen date and concluded them two weeks later in the evening. The Cherokees exchanged intentions at their local townhouse and held the ceremonial rites at sundown by the fire seven days later. The Mohawks also traditionally got married at sunset and had a large feast afterwards.\n\nEach tribe and each clan within the tribe will have their own customs; some very similar, some different. However, the common factor is the importance of sharing this special moment with the community. When choosing a time to hold your wedding ceremony, consider the elements you will include in the ceremony and the capacity of friends and family to join you. For instance, if you are having a fire ceremony, you may want to hold it near sundown.\n\n#### Ceremonies\n\n![](image\u002F404)\n\nTraditional Native American weddings ceremonies can include one or more of several smaller traditions within the larger one:\n\n**Fire Ceremony:** The Manataka American Indian Council states that, in this ceremony, a fire circle is created using stones and seven types of wood. There is one large, unlit stack of firewood built in the centre of the circle and two small fires built that sit to the north and south of the circle. These small fires represent the bride and groom's individual lives. After the two small fires are lit, prayers are offered by the bride and groom, and they then push their individual fires into the centre stack of wood, igniting one large fire.\n\n**Water Ceremony:** Brides may pour water on the groom's hands to represent their new union. Some notes stated that both the bride and groom wash their hands to remove old memories and past wrongdoings.\n\n**Basket Ceremony:** In this ceremony, according to the Manataka American Indian Council, the bride and groom exchange baskets filled with gifts. The baskets symbolize the dowries traditionally required to be exchanged by the bride and groom's families. Gifts may consist of bread, corn, and meat.\n\n**Blanket Ceremony:** Some tribes traditionally participated in wedding blanket ceremonies. In one example of this ceremony, the bride and groom are first wrapped individually in blue blankets. While wrapped in the blankets, the officiant blesses the couple's union. The blankets are then removed and the couple wrapped in a single white blanket. The blue blankets represent the elements of the couple's individual past lives, and the white blanket the couple's dedication to filling their new lives with peace and happiness. The blanket ceremony is used in Cherokee wedding ceremonies, according to the First Nation Ministry.\n\n#### Attire, Jewelry and Music\n\n![](image\u002F406)\n\nFor wedding Dresses and Groom's Attire, many couples wear ceremonial clothing for special occasions like weddings, often referred to as regalia. Native American brides usually wear red or other bright colours instead of white to their ceremony, and their dress may be passed down through generations, according to Native Net. Depending on the tribe, location, and type of wedding, some women and men may wear modern wedding attire.\n\nCeremonial clothing can differ from tribe to tribe. For example, in a Cherokee wedding, the bride wears all white garb consisting of a white dress and moccasins. The dress in colonial times was made from pieces of cloth that tribal women tore into squares or rectangles. Some women today wear traditional style tear dress (made of calico and featuring geometric shapes). Cherokee grooms traditionally wore black pants, moccasins, and a red shirt adorned with ribbons.\n\nThe Algonquin tribes’ brides and grooms wore traditional clothing made by hand; the Northern California tribes use symbolic colours like blue, yellow, and black in wedding attire, while the Hopis ware deerskin leggings as part of the bridal dress.\n\nWhen it comes to Jewelry during wedding ceremonies, Native Americans did not create Jewelry like wedding rings. However, contemporary tradition includes them in metals like sterling silver using turquoise stones for ladies' rings or opal for men's rings.\n\nAs for music and dancing: Flutes, vocals, and drums were used during special ceremonies like weddings. Some tribes have special ritual dances that may be performed at social occasions like weddings. These dances may include the crow hop, shake dance, round dance, or ribbon dance notes of the Nanticoke Indian Tribe.\n\n#### Vows\n\nEach tribe has different events and sayings that occur during the exchange of vows. One of the processes of exchanging vows is referred to as the Rite of the Seven Steps. This Rite's creation can be attributed to numerous tribes throughout the nation, reports the Manataka American Indian Council. Although no \"bridal party\" as it is known today is involved in traditional Native American weddings, this exchange involves guests.\n\nIn the Rite, the couple takes seven steps clockwise around a sacred fire. The groom takes the first step, stops and recites a vow. The bride follows suit. This ritual continues until both the bride and groom complete seven steps. In some instances, the bride and groom exchange small gifts symbolizing their love and life together, such as ears of corn, feathers or stones, at each step. Corn represents fertility, feathers, loyalty, and stones strength. As the bride and groom take their symbolic walk, guests join hands and circle around them and the fire.\n\nAfribadger Team",

                title: "Indigenous Handicrafts to keep for yourself; What to Pack Back Home!",
                text: "In previous articles, we have highlighted packing essentials when visiting unique destinations; Today, we'll be shedding light on what to *bring* home.\n\nSouvenirs not only give you a chance to remember some of the most treasured moments of your experience, but they are also a great way to contribute to the local handicrafts economy, and it is one of the best ways to give back to the community.\n\nArticrafts and locally made products are often unique and irreplaceable, generally impossible to find anywhere else, and you should always leave some room in your bag for them. Just make sure to buy local and to support some local indigenous artists!\n\nNow, let's see just some of the most common and treasured handicrafts usually travellers bring back home after one of the Afribadger's experiences.\n\n#### Mayan textiles, thousands of years old patterns:\n\n![](image\u002F400)\n\nMany indigenous communities all over the world have very extended textile production. In particular, the Mayan have kept this tradition alive for thousands of years; this is why some of their patterns are considered important cultural heritage, and people proudly wear them every day. Usually, women are the artists behind these intricate pieces made of colourful and soft cotton. The threads' preparation is a very lengthy process that includes multiple washes and dyes baths. While visiting Central and Latin America, make sure to stock up!\n\n#### Amazigh and Moroccan carpets:\n\n![](image\u002F401)\n\nNorthern Africa's nomadic populations are renowned for their incredible handwoven carpets productions. With millions of years of old traditional designs, we can safely say that the carpets are never out of fashion, and they usually adorn even the most minimal and modern households. Many Amazigh families today sustain themselves with their production of carpets. Since it is needed a great mastery to hand-weave a rug, they often pass their skills (unique knotting or dying techniques) from generation to generation to ensure their products' quality and originality. The carpets might sometimes come with a label certificating its authenticity.\n\nWe know that it is difficult to make room in your backpack for an Amazigh carpet; this is why we suggest you check shipping processes and solutions before departing. Trust us; you will want one for your home!\n\n**Malekula Island, not only ceremonial masks:**\n\n![](image\u002F398)\n\nMalekula Island is known for its impressive ceremonial masks, some of which are auctioned for millions outside their country. Carvers are pretty well established on the island, and usually, men introduce their sons to the business. But masks are not the only thing to look forward to buying on the island; there is an incredible variety of handicrafts, from jewellery to even furniture. Black palm wood and bamboo are the most common woods used because of their flexibility, and they are easier to carve. The designs are up to the artist's taste and style, and you will have a very vast selection to choose from.\n\nWe always suggest being careful with coral, shells, or bones' handicrafts as they could bring you some troubles at customs. They are also considered an unethical option since it might contribute to some local wildlife's extinction.\n\n#### Himba jewellery, better than diamonds:\n\n![](image\u002F399)\n\nHimba women are renowned for their ethereal beauty, and the jewellery is carefully chosen to adorn them are only a frame to their incredible aura. Ancient jewellery is still worn by both women and men, consisting of numerous arms and legs bracelets (the last one are helpful to prevent snakebites), and necklaces. They often weigh as much as 40 kg, but they are worth the burden because they are spectacularly flamboyant. They are often made of ostrich eggshell, cloth, grass and even copper.\n\nThe famous sizeable white cone shell pendant worn by the women is called the ohumba. It is considered a fertility amulet.\n\nTry to get some grass necklaces made by Himba women, and it will make an excellent gift for your friends!\n\n#### Australian Boomerang:\n\n![](image\u002F403)\n\nIt might seem obvious to some, but the boomerang is one of the most common handicrafts brought back by travellers after a trip to Australia. Although, not many know that it is an ancient aboriginal weapon and was used for hunting Kangaroos. Today boomerangs can have different shapes and are made of the finest woods, hand-painted or left at its original texture. It is an incredible decorative piece, but you might also find some purposely made for throwing in your backyard.\n\n**Just some reminders for responsible purchasing:**\n\nBe careful with wildlife trading; it is still a sad reality in most countries. *Travellers are considered to be inadvertently supporters of a growing marketplace for trafficking rare and endangered wildlife products as souvenirs.*\n\nIf you see it in a market, it does not mean it is legal to buy it, and these are often illegal to export or import. You will encounter harsh fines at customs, and you will be considered part of the trafficked at-risk species market, which is a danger to global health, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n**Here is a list of the items to avoid:**\n\n*- \"Antique\"* carved ivory tusk (they are never antique)\n\n\\- coral jewellery\n\n\\- Snake wine or reptile goods in general\n\n\\- Tortoiseshell accessories\n\n\\- Marine shells (now an endangered species)\n\n\\- Objects or medicine made from protected plants; furs from tigers, most spotted cats, seals, polar bears, sea otters, live monkeys or apes.\n\n-Certain leather products, including some made from caiman, crocodiles, lizards and snakes; some orchids, cacti, and cycads; medicinals made from rhino, tiger, or Asiatic black bear. THESE ARE DANGEROUS FOR HUMAN HEALTH (a hazard for future pandemics).\n\nIn all cases, different counties have different restrictions on imported items, so make sure to check your custom's regulation.\n\nAfribadger Team\n\nCover photo, Peruvian woman spinning wool by hand, iStock.com\u002F[hadynyah](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002Fhadynyah?mediatype=photography)",

                title: "Modern Technology and The Indigenous Communities",
                text: "Over the years, technology has revolutionised our world and daily lives. From GPS to Computers to smartphones, technology has put unique tools and resources at our fingertips, making our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun. But what about Tribal Peoples? Or as sometimes called First Peoples, Native Peoples, and Indigenous Peoples, these original inhabitants with their 4,000 unique languages constitute about 6.2% of the world's population. Have their lives been affected by technology? And if yes, how?\n\nIt is not a secret that Indigenous peoples are pragmatic by nature; especially if an innovation makes life easier, more comfortable, or provides other desired benefits, they are as likely as anyone else to incorporate it into their lives. When such changes are of their choosing, they comfortably adapt their cultures to them. And Technology has gained its way to Indigenous people through many organisations dedicated to the utilisation of Technology in Indigenous communities.\n\nNowadays, Indigenous peoples utilise video conferencing technology, digitisation of documents, and radio broadcast over the Internet. The majority of these technologies are used to preserve and promote Indigenous culture, tradition, history, and human rights advocacy. Further, The Internet is used by various Indigenous groups for email, chat rooms, radio stations, video-conferencing, and simple information-gathering by browsing Web sites or exercising their rights as citizens.\n\n#### First Nations Communities in Canada.\n\n![](image\u002F394)\n\nThey have recently adopted Internet voting to facilitate participation in votes, such as general assemblies for community ratification of constitutional provisions.\n\nOn the other hand, educational programs promoting and addressing the technology needs of Indigenous peoples or through governments and institutions who have launched dedicated Programmes and collaborated with tribes and technology accessible to indigenous people in their habitat, many to overcome some challenges they face on the day to day lives.\n\n#### Indigenous Tribes in Brazil\n\n![](image\u002F395)\n\nThe Brazilian government launched a project in collaboration with the Amazon conservation team and four tribes to map ten million acres of the tribes’ ancestral lands.\n\nThe regions mapped included the Tumucumaque Indigenous Park and the Rio Paru d’Este Indigenous Land, covering areas occupied by the Apalia, Wayana, Tirio, and Kaxuyana tribes. The mapping process involved consulting tribal elders on their traditional knowledge of the heavily forested areas and its place names, and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was used to plot the boundaries.\n\nThese four tribes will now be able to organise better and develop their resources. They have been careful to document hunting trails and holy places, while not revealing the location of coveted medicinal plants. And The map also proves that the four tribes occupy the entire territory, which will help them fight against gold miners on their land.\n\n#### The Nenets in Siberia\n\n![](image\u002F397)\n\nAnother case of implementing GPS technology took place with the Nenets in Siberia. The tribe's main activity is reindeer herding in northern Russia's challenging regions. Shepherd families have to frequently travel long distances to find pastures and communication between different groups through their online devices, facilitating their easy location and exchanging information in case of emergency. This new tool has led to a clear improvement in their quality of life without affecting their most ancient customs.\n\nTo sum up, in today's technologically rich and dependent world, indigenous peoples fully understand new technologies' importance. Access on par with other people and groups protects indigenous peoples from subordination by those with greater technological might. It opens doors to new opportunities to meet their needs and realise their aspirations. In today's highly competitive world, it helps to level a playing field that is still fogged and swampy in the indigenous zone but clear and dry where Westerners play.\n\nBut unlike the new technologies of years gone by, today's technological innovations are centred on knowledge, information, and communication. They provide the means needed to gather and act on new ideas, share ideas and ways of doing things with others, and record past and present ways to not forget in the future. Whereas guns once helped indigenous peoples fend off incursions that stripped them of aspects of their identity, today's technology provides indigenous peoples' means to reinforce and assert those identities.\n\nAfribadger Team\n\nCover photo, Group of Masai, iStock.com\u002Fborchee",

                text: "#### Breaking prejudices and starting over:\n\nSuppose you are thinking of going to Georgia and seeing some of the most beautiful landscapes, green mountains and flora and fauna in the world. In that case, you should probably know one of two things about the Kist people, who will host you in their beautiful territories. These areas are so culturally diverse that they have been in the middle of many controversies. Nevertheless, today, the Kists are determined to change what other communities think of these mountains of them.\n\n![](image\u002F393)\n\nThey live close to the border with Chechnya, from where they are from, but they settled in Pankisi between 1830-1870. To escape deportation in 1944 carried out by the Soviet Union, they registered as Georgian citizens and adopted Georgian surnames. But that wasn't the only war going to mark their community indelibly. In the early 90s, the First and the Second Chechen War became the headline of most newspapers worldwide, and many refugees from Russia sought asylum in these same mountains. Already socially excluded, the Kists saw war, violence and an unfortunate raising distorted perception of their culture.\n\n![](image\u002F390)\n\nToday, however, war is a long-gone memory, and the Kists want to share their culture and traditions with all the people they host, breaking all prejudices. Warm and caring, they Kists are one of the most friendly community you can visit, and they will share with you all the secrets these mountains carry within them. Even younger generations are investing more in the community by studying tourism at the University of Tbilisi.\n\nKists' religion is mainly syncretisation of Sunni Muslim with animistic folk religion and some Christians. You should dress accordingly, covering legs and shoulders and alcohol is not permitted in the communities.\n\n#### Trekking in the High Caucasus Mountains with Afribadger:\n\n![](image\u002F392)\n\nWith Afribadger experience in Pankisi, you will immerse yourself with nature from day number one. The unforgettable trekking experiences (and horse riding) will give you the possibility to bring some of the most beautiful views of the High Caucasus back home with you.\n\nThe first peak you will reach is Tbatana; its village has an altitude of 2450 m, and you will see the Kakheti and the Pankisi gorge from all its beauty. Here, you will camp in a tent in the wilderness of these breathtaking mountains; you will rest after eating some traditional cheese made freshly from the pastures of the Caucasian Mountains.\n\n**Tusheti, touching the sky.**\n\nThe second peaks you will reach are the mountains to Khevsureti and Tusheti. Be ready for an incredible trek, challenging, but fantastic. The final view will not only be worth the challenging ascent, but it will probably worth the trip altogether. The view from here is so great that you will feel like being on the top of the world at 4,800 m of altitude. The villages in the area will give you plenty of opportunities to meet local communities and experience their culture, from shepherding practices to tasting delicious and freshly made local food.\n\n![](image\u002F391)\n\nOnce you are back to Pankisi Gorge and Nazy's guesthouse, you will rest and experience the Kists' lifestyle of those who reside in the village. From felt-making to cooking classes, you will be able to immerse yourself culturally. For those of you loving the outdoors, they can plan biking experiences to enjoy this incredible natural hidden gems of Eurasia to its maximum potential.\n\n**Cheese and Herds:**\n\nWhile staying in the mountains, you will eat a large variety of cheeses. The herders of these areas are part of the Tush community. Their Gouda cheese has nothing to do with the European version, but it is known to be delicious thanks to the Pankisi mountains' grass quality. In summer, herders start the slow ascent to the highest peaks and leave cows free in the green fields. They usually only cheese and bread during these few months and they prepare cheese all day after milking the cows at least twice daily. Once the cheese is ready, they submerge it in salty water to preserve it, and this gives it its particular taste.\n\n**Afribadger Team**\n\nCover photo, Performance, Men, Georgia, iStock.com\u002FOzbalci",

                title: "The Cofan Tribe: Modern Rainforest Protectors",
                text: "The Cofan tribe fought for years against invaders and oil companies to protect the land where they lived, and they are known today as protectors of the rainforest. They were initially warriors, craftsmen and traders living between the Guamués and the Aguaricó River, in Ecuador and close to Colombia's border.\n\nIn recent years, their environment has been polluted and destroyed, and they were forced to seek refuge in deeper parts of the forest reduced to two small areas and two reserves.\n\n**Today, there are less than a thousand Cofán remaining in Ecuador.**\n\n![](image\u002F387)\n\nHowever, their culture and ancestral language, A'ingae, resist and remain strong. The Cofan have even partnered with other indigenous communities to launch a powerful initiative to develop their solutions to the water and health crisis affecting their territory.\n\nToday, the tribe represents the last remnants of one of the most knowledgeable and rich cultures that ever emerged from the Amazon basin. Let's discover together something more about their current way of life and what to experience in our travels.\n\n#### Pack your suitcase and visit Zabalo village!\n\n[Meet the Cofan and explore the nature of their territories with us](https:\u002F\u002Fnomadictribe.com\u002Ftribes\u002Fthe-cofan?region=south_america)!\n\n![](image\u002F386)\n\nYou will start from Zabalo village and the amazing surrounding forest exploring waterways, streams, and lagoons floating in traditional canoes to move in this high biodiversity environment: over 3000 woody plants, over 300 species per hectare!\n\n#### Zabalo river: the first Quite Park in the world.\n\n![](image\u002F388)\n\nDo you know that Zabalo River has been named the world's first Quiet Park in 2019? Nature's voice is the only soundtrack that marks this forest's days along the Zabalo River, where silence has been protected as a natural resource. There are no transport routes here-neither residential nor commercial developments. You can't even hear a plane passing overhead. Cofan were the first defenders of the World's First Certified Quiet Park, extending over one million acres and it's part of their territories. Quiet Parks International, an agency dedicated to spreading peace worldwide, now hopes that many other parks will follow the example of the Zabalo, banning noise pollution and protecting silence.\n\n[A taste of Zabalo river here](https:\u002F\u002Fvimeo.com\u002F328361438)\n\n#### Sleep in Zabalo river camp.\n\nIn this unique experience, you will have the opportunity to camp and sleep in Zabalo incredible park, in one of the campsites specially prepared for you! You'll be able to go out and explore this wonderland with Cofan guides that will guide you in discovering some secrets of nature and Cofan culture. You'll get the chance to catch piranha and other game fish … and, if lucky, taste some of them during one of the local meals. Ready for this experience in close contact with nature? Run to pack your bags!\n\n#### How Cofan live today.\n\n![](image\u002F384)\n\nIn recent years, over losing their land, Cofan has to deal with toxic spills and contaminated water. The stress caused by this situation forced many to abandon their original settlements and adopt a modernized way of life. For example, many Cofan embraces education for their children and creates alliances with outside organizations, such as the Chicago Field Museum and various USA foundations. Some of the new generations send their children to private schools in Quito and universities in the US. The Cofan territory has zero deforestation and zero damage done to the land. They are working on carbon credit plans to allow wealthy nations to pay the Cofan to protect the rainforest.\n\n#### Cofan ecotourism and conservation.\n\nThe Cofán began the first community-based ecotourism project in the rainforests of Northern Ecuador back in 1978: ecotourism may offer a sustainable development option for indigenous communities based on the natural environment supply to the visitors. The communal profits are used to finance the legalization of lands and the local organization. The development of local skills through ecotourism allows community members to expand their activities in collaboration with tourism operators. More than this, more significant financial resources will enable the community to improve the management and monitoring of the communal forests and educate young people to become the future leaders of the community in a long term process and vision.\n\n#### Cofán Survival Fund.\n\nOne example of a Cofan dedicated Fund is the CFS. Founded in 1999, the Fundación Sobrevivencia Cofán is an organization with Cofán leadership dedicated to the survival of the Cofán indigenous culture and its Amazonian rainforest environment. The Fund focuses on finding practical, on-the-ground solutions that contribute to the Cofán Nation's survival and is committed to biodiversity conservation and research, protecting ancestral territory together with their natural resources and educating the community's youngest generation.\n\nCofan Survival has received grants from both government and private sources for activities directed to the conservation of ancestral territories in northeastern Ecuador and developing strategies to allow Cofán people to maintain cultural and economic stability working in synergy with the government and other associations.\n\nAfribadger Team",

                title: "New Year's in Indigenous Communities",
                text: '**New Year\'s is celebrated all over the world as a symbolic step in someone\'s life. It is the perfect excuse for us to prepare the heinous list "of good intentions" to do or start doing during the year to come.**\n\nIf there is something we realized more during 2020, is that it is crucial to explore, meet new cultures, and see how some communities celebrate important festivities. **We know that travelling more is on your list for the new year**, but until it is possible to safely do it again, we will bring to you some of the traditions and customs around the world.\n\nToday, most countries refer to the Gregorian calendar, based on the solar year that follows the seasons\' course and has 12 months composed from 28 to 31 days. However, some indigenous communities celebrate the new year on the winter solstice day, leaving behind winter\'s harshness and the hibernal cold that stopped the agriculture.\n\nThe symbolism is pretty straightforward, celebrating the renewal of life and honouring mother earth. Even if some communities live in a country that today follows the Gregorian Calendar, indigenous populations prefer to honour the year\'s end with their traditional customs and keep millennial traditions alive. **Let\'s discover some!**\n\n#### Willkakuti, the Andean and Amazonian New Year:\n\n![](image\u002F371)\n\nWillka Kuti, means "return of the sun" in Aymara and it is the most common New Year celebration in the Andean-Amazonian communities, observed in more than 200 different locations throughout South America.\n\nIt takes place during the winter solstice and has been a tradition for thousands of years. Finally, in 2010, the Bolivian president Evo Morales, of Aymara descent, declared its national holiday. It is the most spiritual day for the Aymara people, which on June 21st in thousands meet in Bolivia\'s high plateau region to celebrate the new year\'s arrival.\n\nMany rituals are performed, and offerings are made to the Pachamama, mother earth, and dances last all night long. Before sunrise, offers are given to the deities and ancestors in the semi-subterranean temple of Tiwanaku. All participants go to the sun\'s mystical gate and with their arms raised to receive the cosmic energy of the first rays of light in the new year. Everything is accompanied by traditional music, drums and Quenas, the Andean flutes, add the rhythm to this breathtaking ritual.\n\n#### The New Year Yhyach in Siberian villages\n\n![](image\u002F369)\n\nYhyach (meaning "abundance") is the most important festival celebrated, and it takes place between June 10th and June 25th depending on local preferences. The village\'s shaman is dressed in white and opens the ceremony accompanied by seven virgin girls and nine virgin boys, especially since the solar deity is a fertility cult. Prays are sung to honour the spirits and nature. National competitions and games are held during this time, and traditional food is prepared. The festival takes place in a large space, where the great Tree of the World can be found. This is the symbol of the universe\'s connection: the tree is in the "middle world", its roots are in the "lower world" and its branches in the "upper world".\n\nYakut communities celebrate the New Year twice a year, their traditional one and the gregorian calendar one. Since winter temperatures sometimes reach −60 °C, the festival is celebrated in the middle of June.\n\n#### Ugadi - Indian Telugu and Kannada New Year\n\n![](image\u002F375)\n\nUgadi is celebrated during the first new moon after the Spring Equinox by people living in the southern Indian states of Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. This festivity takes place between the end of March and the beginning of April.\n\nPreparations for the celebration start a week before and include scrubbing down the house and purchasing new clothing. On the day of Ugadi, people adorn their homes with mango leaves called *Torana* and colourful patterns made of rice, flower petals or sand called *Rangoli*, buying and giving gifts such as new clothes, giving charity to the poor, special bath followed by oil treatment, preparing and sharing an exceptional food called pachadi, and visiting Hindu temples.\n\n#### Aluth Avurudda - Sri lankan New Years\n\n![](image\u002F372)\n\nThe Sinhalese and Tamil Hindus of Sri Lanka observe New Year\'s in mid-April: they open their doors to family, friends, and various community members. The new year is celebrated through various customs and rituals: for example, boiling milk in a new earthen pot until it boils over, symbolizes prosperity. Rituals connected with *Aluth Avurudda* commence with bathing on the last day of the old year (*Parana Avurudda*). In the village temple, this period is characterized by the bell\'s pealing accompanied by the beating of drums (*Hewisi*) to make people aware of festivity and rituals. The community used to prepare and serve rice and coconut oil sweets, such as traditional *kavum*, and dishes with plantains.\n\n#### Mayan New Year\n\n![](image\u002F370)\n\nMayan indigenous people remain faithful to their ancient traditions and celebrate Mayan New Year as their ancestors: participants must wear new hats, and carry Mayan bags.\n\nHowever, in the Mayan culture, there is no specific date to celebrate the New Year: its calendar does have 365 days, it lacks leap years including 18 months of 20 days each, and five additional days called "*aciagos*" (meaning "fateful"). The festivities feature rituals, dancing and singing accompanied by plenty of blue colours, considered a sacred hue in Mayan culture. The ceremonies usually take place both at sunrise and sunset. One way to keep track of time coexist within the Maya calendar is the solar cycle ("haab"): the beginning of each New Year according to the Mayans is celebrated approximately every July, and each one represents a different phase or personality.\n\n**Nowruz the Persian New Year**\n\n![](image\u002F377)\n\nNowruz is the Persian meaning of "new day" and is the Iranian New Year, usually taking place on March 21st. It is the day of the vernal equinox and marks the beginning of spring.\n\nCelebrated for over 3000 years, Nowruz can be found in Western Asia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Black Sea Basin, the Balkans, and South Asia, and it has nothing to do with faith. Trumpets are played to strike the new year while people decor their table with coloured eggs and cups of grains to honour the harvest and flowers and delicious traditional food.\n\nAfribadger Team\n\nCover photo, "Dancers in Uzbekistan celebrate Nowruz".

                title: "Discover the Mayan Tribe in Mexico! Unknown Places and Curiosities.",
                text: 'Mexico! Its beaches, colours, music, spicy foods… there are many reasons to visit this great Country… today we talk about an added motivation: the discovery of Mayan culture. From Teotihuacán to the gates of Mexico, to the jungle of Palenque, passing by the pyramids of Chichén Itzá or the unique site of Tulum, Mexico is home to the fantastic testimonies of the Mayan civilization. Its discovery justifies the decision to pack and leave for this destination soon. Let’s see why!\n\n#### Mexico: a Mayan or Aztec Country?\n\n![](image\u002F360)\n\nHere is the difference: the Aztecs were Nahuatl-speaking people who lived in central Mexico in the 14th to 16th centuries. The Maya are the indigenous people of Mexico and Central America. They have continuously inhabited the lands comprising modern-day Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco, and Chiapas in Mexico and southward through Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and the Honduras.\n\n#### Mayan culture persists nowadays.\n\nGreat Maya metropolises have declined, but indigenous people have not disappeared. Mayan people endured almost five centuries after the Spanish conquest and their cultural traditions, lifestyle, habits, and festivals are still alive today.\n\n#### How many Mayans lived today in Mexico?\n\nThere are more than 20 distinct Maya peoples within Guatemala and Mexico, each with their own culture, tradition, and language. In general, the Maya number today is about six million people. Some of the largest Maya groups are found in Mexico, such as the Yucatecs (300,000), the Tzotzil (120,000) and the Tzeltal (80,000).\n\n#### Talking about numbers … the Maya concept of zero\n\n![](image\u002F363)\n\nFew people knows that the Maya numerical system is based on factors of 20 and that zero in the Maya written language was represented by a shell-shaped glyph. Numbers are composed of units of 1, 20, 400, and so on. One example: to write the number 405, a Maya would use a symbol for: one unit of 400, zero units of 20, and five units of 1. That is how they derived the concept of zero.\n\n#### Visit less known places! Nuevo Durango and Mayan community.\n\n![](image\u002F362)\n\nMost people have never heard of Nuevo Durango. This small town offers some exciting eco-tourism projects characterized by beautiful nature, support of local tourism and the discovery of a different side of Mexico, out of the mass tourism market. [Check the experience proposed by Afribadger here.](https:\u002F\u002Fnomadictribe.com\u002Ftribes\u002Fthe-maya\u002Ftrips) Between the activities, the visit of the jungle reserve known as Punta Laguna, a vast community eco area where you can go see monkeys, walk trails, canoe, rappel into a cenote and much more; another example? The visit of Manuel’s deer farm: a conservation space created by Manuel and his family in 2006. Four species of animals in danger of extinction are hosted there and are responsible for reproducing and releasing them in protected areas where hunting is prohibited.\n\n#### Who are the Yaxunah community?\n\n![](image\u002F364)\n\nHave you ever heard about Yaxunah community? Yaxunah are a small Mayan community of 700 inhabitants, in the municipality of Yaxcabá, Yucatan. Yaxunah is also the name of an archaeological site located only a 25-minute ride from the famous city of Chichen Itzá, the most visited Yucatan archaeological site. It is an excellent option to take as a base and explore different archaeological ruins of the area. Discover with us a sustainable cornfield managed by the community, learn to produce drinks based on corn or learn to prepare a typical Mayan meal, cooked in the underground pib oven wrapped in banana leaves. You can get in touch with the community and experience some of their traditions.\n\n#### What about Ek Balam archaeological site and community?\n\n![](image\u002F367)\n\nEk Balam is an archaeological site and still a relatively little-known Mayan jewel. At Ek Balam you will find one of the last yet scalable pyramids. Find calm and tranquillity, fewer people than the more famous Mayan sites of Chichén Itza and Palenque. More: the view of the surrounding jungle landscape is fantastic. The Acropolis, 32 meters high, is among the tallest pyramids in the Yucatán. On its base, 160 meters long, there is a gallery, it is a whole structure in separate rooms, on several levels. Going up the steps, it is possible to admire the beautiful stuccoes preserved under the thatched roofs. Surprisingly, many of them are still original; they have not been restored. Tips for travellers: get plenty of water, the heat is intense! If you arrive early in the morning, you may be able to visit the site in total solitude. Our trip proposes a visit to Ek Balam community tour, where you will visit three families from the community that will open the doors of their homes to share with visitors’ part of their culture and traditions.\n\n#### The Maya loved to use sauna: recommended experience!\n\nIt seems that ancient Maya enjoyed steamy stone saunas, known as temascal in Yucatán Peninsula. Mayan saunas are still popular. Ancient Maya cities built saunas of stone or adobe mud: the Maya combined water with fire-heated rocks to create steam. In recent years, there has been a massive revival of interest in the ancient Mayan practise of [steam baths](https:\u002F\u002Ftheculturetrip.com\u002Fnorth-america\u002Fmexico\u002Farticles\u002Fwhy-this-mexican-steam-bath-ritual-is-making-a-comeback\u002F). Held in a stone, igloo-like structure, [temazcal](https:\u002F\u002Ftheculturetrip.com\u002Fnorth-america\u002Farticles\u002Fspa-sauna-traditions-world\u002F) ceremonies are designed to cleanse the body and mind of negativities and impurities. Experience highly recommended for: detoxify the body, purify the respiratory system, improved mental performance, increase stress resilience and much more.\n\n#### Pioneers in the elaboration of chocolate!\n\n![](image\u002F366)\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the Mayans began eating chocolate 2600 years ago. In those days they were already capable of processing cocoa and mixed it with water, honey and spices, giving life to a strong and spicy drink that offered a lot of energy and that they continue to make today. The Mayans turned chocolate into an art form and it was a very important part of celebrations and rituals.\n\n#### The Mayans were the first to domesticate turkeys.\n\n![](image\u002F365)\n\nThere is evidence that the Mayans were the first to domesticate turkeys. The colonizers took them to Europe and later to North America where today it is a fundamental element of traditional cuisine. In the Mayan empire, turkeys, in addition to being a source of food, provided bones and feathers for the creation of decorative elements and for domestic use such as fans, musical instruments and work tools. If you visit Mayan communities today, you will discover that they continue to raise turkeys known as "Indian turkeys", which have not undergone genetic change and are consumed during religious festivals in rural communities or at important family events (for example, weddings or baptisms).\n\nAfribadger Team\n\nCover photo, Mayan women. iStock.com\u002F[Photo Beto](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002FRobertoArmocida?mediatype=photography)',

                title: "5 Things That Will Surprise You When Travelling to Malekula Island",
                text: "Malekula is Vanuatu's second-largest island, and it is an exceptional adventure destination shining like a rare gem in the vastity of the Pacific Ocean. With 30 different languages but only around 25,000 inhabitants, its history and culture are connected with the untouched jungle characterising its landscape.\n\nTwo indigenous communities are keeping traditions alive on the island regardless of the raising interest that travellers showed to their singular customs.\n\nIf you are packing for your next trip to Malekula, here you can find some curiosities on the Big and Small Nambas that could help you understand better the particularities of their traditions and connect with these two incredible cultures on the next level.\n\n#### Gastronomy is one of their best talents:\n\n![](image\u002F356)\n\nVanuatu national dish is Laplap, grated breadfruit, bananas, taro, yam roots paste. Then, once added some coconut cream, everything is gets wrapped in banana leaves, or into bamboo tubes, which are then cooked over a fire. It is common to add some meat to the dish.\n\nIn the past, the Nambas were also known to practice cannibalism, which is today abolished! This would happen after a war between villages to demonstrate one village's power over the other. Today, it is possible to visit some sites in the jungle where these prisoners would have been kept and killed during these wars.\n\n#### Regular battles but same background:\n\n![](image\u002F355)\n\nThe Big Nambas living on the Northern territories of the island and the Small Nambas living on the Southern's have been rivals for centuries and wars were frequent. The thickness of the island's jungle didn't facilitate dialogue and connection among villages, raising tensions between communities. Even if they share some cultural traits, the main difference is the sheath made of banana leaves men wear over their penis. Big Nambas wear a bigger one and Small Nambas a smaller.\n\nToday, most of the arguments between villages are handled through the villages' elders and often concern infidelity or land ownership disputes.\n\n#### Dances, celebrations and vibrant life in the villages:\n\n![](image\u002F359)\n\nCelebrations are numerous, and they often are an excellent occasion to reunite with the community. Usually performed in traditional costumes, the men wear leaves skirts, and palm nuts rattles attached to their ankles, which help to build the rhythm and to involve the audience with charming beats. An occasion to dace that should not be missed!\n\n#### Tourism as a useful tool to preserve culture:\n\nVillages chiefs see tourism as an opportunity to keep their culture alive and engage with the newer generations. They are determined to pass on their knowledge to children ensuring the future of their legacy. You will notice how charming they are with visitors, as they are known for their courtesy.\n\n#### Untouched jungle and breathtaking fauna:\n\n![](image\u002F357)\n\nThe island of Malekula has incredibly resisted to any attempt to destroy its wildlife and jungle to build a big city and hotels to welcome travellers. Its wilderness is well known to be breathtaking, and its bush host one of the richest biodiversities in the world. This is not only an opportunity to see some exceptional animals but also to experience life without what we are now, unfortunately, all used to, concrete and buildings all around. So get your shoes ready (and insect repellant as well), to fully immerse yourself in nature.\n\nCheck out more about the Big &amp; Small Nambas in our tibes section!\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nCover photo \u002F Tribal dance in Malekula Island \u002F iStock.com\u002F[PietroPazzi](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002FPietroPazzi?mediatype=photography)",

                title: "Indigenous People’s Sustainable Means of Transportation",
                text: "#### The Connection with the Surrounding Environment\n\nTraveling with Afribadger is discovering new worlds, different lifestyles and ancient cultures that have survived the passing of time. But it is not only that, the most important thing is to live with the indigenous people and share their habits and traditions.\n\nTherefore, when we travel to a tribe we adapt to their daily routines and one of them is their means of transportation. We forget about our cars, our motorcycles and our modern vehicles and we immerse ourselves in times gone by also through their means of transport.\n\nCan you imagine moving from city to city on an reindeer sledge, or walking down the street on a camel? Traveling with Afribadger is that and much more.\n\nThe means of transport used by Indigenous People have developed over the centuries to cover freight and people transport needs and to guarantee a connection with other territory areas and many of them have not changed for centuries.\n\nTheir development or identification was strictly connected to the territory: whether it is desert areas, mountains, lakes or islands, Indigenous People have been able to adapt to the environment and choose the most appropriate means of transportation.\n\nHere are some examples to discover together… What are you waiting for to try one of them during your next trip?\n\n#### NORTH CANADA: Inuit and other First Nation People – The Canoe and Kayak\n\n![](image\u002F340)\n\nIf you visit the Inuit, you will have to prepare yourself to cross the frigid waters of lakes in the North by Kayaking! Ready for the challenge?\n\nDo you know that the Alaskan Inuit people were the first to build and use kayaks at least 4,000 years ago? Historically, canoes and kayaks were built for hunting, fishing, transportation, trade, warfare, gifts and ceremonies and have always represented some of Canada's most important vessels. All because northern North America is a unique but even challenging land of lakes, rivers and coasts and the canoes were since the beginning a resourceful response to this environment.\n\nKayaks are small, narrow boats made of wood, with a sealed sealskin cabin to prevent the rower from sinking should the boat capsize.\n\nThe word kayak means \"hunter's boat\", as they were originally built for hunting and used to drag animals — seals, caribou, even whales — to shore.\n\n#### SUBARCTIC AREA: Inuit, Nenets, Sami and Komi People – Reindeer and Dog sledding\n\n![](image\u002F345)\n\nIf you travel with Afribadger to destinations in the Arctic, prepare yourself for unforgettable sleigh rides!\n\nIn subarctic areas and nearly inaccessible areas of the world, the dogs and the reindeers became essential for survival by providing a mode of transportation for both goods and humans themselves.\n\n![](image\u002F343)\n\nA sledge pulled by animals became the best way to transport food and supplies when waterways could not be used inland or due to ports being frozen. Anything would move on sledges pulled by dogs and reindeers: doctors, medicine, tools, news and mail, books and fabrics.\n\nThe indigenous people of Finland, for example, the Sami, believed that the only creatures on earth who had a soul were humans and dogs. The Sami respected and valued the dogs, as they felt they were the thread that connected humans with the surrounding nature. The same goes for the Nenets and other tribes in relation to reindeer. Their physical and spiritual connection dates back to the beginning of their existence.\n\n#### DESERTIC AREA: Berbers – Camels as ships of the desert\n\n![](image\u002F341)\n\nYou won’t find a better mean of transportation than the camels if you travel to visit the Berbers!\n\nThis means of transportation has been used for transporting goods across Asian and North Africa deserts for thousands of years. They are the only desert animals able to carry heavy loads of goods and travel for an extended period without food or water.\n\nBerbers people held the key to travelling across the Sahara learning to thrive in its vast sand dunes. They learned to exploit camels and their natural adaptations for desert survival to travel and trade in the region. Berbers used natural indicators to guide their voyage across the Sahara: they found their way by examining the stars, the smell of the sand, the vegetation, and the height of the sun and moon. They paid attention to the mountains in the distance and the shadows of the dunes. This is another example of how the in-depth knowledge of the territory, together with the choice of the right means of transport, can allow survival in difficult contexts.\n\n#### MIXED AREAS: Berbers, Mursi,Masai,Titicaca Lake Dwellers – How donkeys become indispensable for many indigenous tribes.\n\n![](image\u002F342)\n\nBe ready to travel by donkey in some of our most impressive destinations!\n\nAfter camels, another important transport animal was and is still the donkey. It is mainly a cargo transport animal though; occasionally, it transports its owners after offloading its load. It was principally used for transporting goods and farm products from the farms to the market. Donkeys were incredibly important, being smaller, more durable, and more comfortable to handle and feed than horses.\n\nThey were and still are used in a lot of African, South America and Asian areas. They are essential in mountainous or particularly steep areas, for example for water transport in case that the source is located in an inaccessible or particularly challenging to reach the place. Some of Indigenous People tribes that still use donkeys as one of the primary means of transportation today are Masai, sedentary Berbers and Mursi Tribe in Africa or Titicaca Dwellers in South America.\n\nAfribadger TEAM",

                title: "Indigenous Contemporary Art",
                text: "Contemporary indigenous artists tell in their works about their community's experiences, and make the tribal heritage their most significant artistic expression. They are frequently politically active, giving voice to what is often not covered by the world press.\n\nIn this article we will explore eight artists who have managed to commemorate their millenary culture in a mix of ancient and new, of past and present, without losing sight of their origins.\n\nIt is clear by now that artistic expression in indigenous groups has been a means of emancipation and the ultimate expression of some of the difficulties that could not be told otherwise, and sometimes carries within itself unfortunate events.\n\nThe indigenous contemporary art scene is vibrant and has only begun a few decades ago to be explored by the international art market.\n\n#### REPUBLIC OF BENIN - African masks, representing contemporary issues\n\n![](image\u002F331)\n\nRomuald Hazoumè is a sculptor and painter from the Republic of Benin born in 1962 in Porto Novo. His major inspirations are the economic and social contexts of African countries, the history of slavery and colonialism.\n\nThe media used by the artist are often waste products found in garbage dumps, and his most known work series is his Tank Masks. The goal is to send a strong social and political message on the smuggling of petrol between Benin and Nigeria. Furthermore, the plastic masks appear ruined, dirty and topped with styled wigs. The artist wants to criticize how the western beauty standards are slowly swiping off the African tribal culture and customs, and the attempt of some African women to eliminate part of their somatic traits with wigs and makeup.

His tribal roots were his main inspiration; however, he wanted to include contemporary, western and Asian influences in his work marrying past and present. The celebration of his heritage in his famous Masks series gained him recognition and success in the 80s. The masks were created for ceremonial purposes, and they were \"danced\" to fully activate their force and reaffirm the power of family and clan, as well as the human connection with the supernatural world. Beau Dick is considered one of the leading artists of Canadian Indigenous art. [Take a deeper look into Chief Beau Dick’s work here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Ucfwb3MFLHQ&feature=emb_title).\n\n#### POLAND - Romany art, breaking stereotypes and resurfacing lost artworks and history\n\n![](image\u002F332)\n\nMałgorzata Mirga-Tas is an artist, activist and anti-racism campaigner of Bergitka Roma origins. She lives in Poland, in a Roma settlement in Czarna Góra in the Spisz region. She dedicated some of her works to Samudaripe – The Roma Genocide during the Second World War, and she is involved in several different social projects fighting against social exclusion and racial discrimination. Her work's primary technique is sculpting in cardboard, and her drawings and paintings are drawn with the use of different media, such as pastels, different types of paints, newspapers, sequins, cardboard and fabrics. Roma typical designs, colours and motifs, are the main protagonists of her work exploring Roma people and their everyday lives. She also fights for recognition in the contemporary art scene of artists’ from Romany backgrounds. [Click here for more info about the artist and her work.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.romarchive.eu\u002Fen\u002Fcollection\u002Fp\u002Fmalgorzata-mirga-tas\u002F)\n\n#### AUSTRALIA - 40,000 years of artistic expression, when past meets present\n\n![](image\u002F327)\n\nThe aboriginal art is well known for the tradition of passing on from generation to generation songs, rituals, dances, symbols and patterns. The stories of the ‘Dreamtime’ are represented in all aboriginal and are so sacred that artists need permission to paint them. Christine Napanangka Michaels is an artist born in the 80s in the Northern Territories. By using bright colours, she depicts the Jukurrpa stories, the main inspiration to all the artist's works. The artist often explores Lappi Lappi dreaming, which is the name of a rock hole and a stable source of water in Western Australia. According to the tradition, during the Jukurrpa time, a colourful snake called Warnayarra was living in the hole. One day, some women and kids started dancing and singing around Lappi Lappi, and the snake got irritated until it came out of the hole and ate them.

As mentioned on the NGV website, *this exhibition explores drawings and markings of figures, signs or text made on public surfaces across Indigenous Australia, from rock face to now*. Some examples? Reko Rennie and Brook Andrew artists translate incisions on carved trees into fluorescent neon icons. In contrast, Josh Muir and Hannah Brontë artists are using video art to disseminate and communicate voices of dissent, trying to facilitate dialogue to effect change.

She’s a Native American visual artist of the Apsáalooke (Crow) lineage, born in Billings, Montana and growing up on a Crow Indian Reservation. Her main works are a kind of surreal self-portrait photographs making fun of white American culture's tendency to misrepresent Native American history. Using materials like target-brand Halloween costumes or plastic animals, Red Star shows and refuses the idealizations of American Indians as “one with nature.” Take a look at some of her colourful works on [her website](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wendyredstar.com\u002F) and [listen her artworks description here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=vyJiXXXH2WE)\n\n#### TANZANIA - The funny Lilanga’s transition from tradition to contemporaneity\n\n![](image\u002F333)\n\nGeorges Lilanga (1943-2005), was a Tanzanian artist belonging to the Makonde ethnic group and internationally recognized as one of the main contemporary African artists.\n\nHe achieved international fame thanks to its particular pictorial style, characterized by a keen sense of social critique and caricature illustrating the continuity of artistic vision among the Makonde and its renewal in the context of the present day.\n\nLilanga's imaginary world is populated by a multitude of characters, named Shetani's, who seem to come out of cartoons. To maintain the detachment from other Makonde sculptors who depict parts of bodies assembled grotesquely to form monstrous beings, the aliens of Lilanga are more sympathetic than terrible and are represented at the moment of maximum fun like small pixies, portrayed in everyday life situations. Curious to meet Lilanga’s Shetanis?

Author of paintings made entirely in white by applying a mixture of rice paste, water and gum resin on treated raw canvases, natural elements such as mud earth. Jivya Soma Mashe was among the first Indian artists to be recognized internationally. In Europe, his works were the protagonists of the legendary exhibition *\"Magiciens de la Terre\"* curated by Jean-Hubert Martin at the Center George Pompidou in Paris. His works have been exhibited all over the world and part of permanent collections at the Crafts Museum in New Delhi, at the Museum Kunstpalast, Dusseldorf and, at the Mithila Museum in Niigata, Japan.

                title: "What You Should Know About the Ukrainian Boykos and Hutsuls Before Visiting Them",
                text: "Ukraine is an incredible destination, and it should be in your next travels' bucket list for many different reasons! Full of history and culture, the country is also well known for its natural heritage and indigenous communities.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains are the so-called \"green pearl\" of Ukraine and their captivating aura has been an inspiration to many of the greatest writers, painters and artists, honouring the incredible beauty of its peaks and valleys. Today, more than 20 natural reserves are preserving natural parks, home to more than 800 animal species but also some of the last European indigenous communities, living traditionally and challenging the modern world while living in harmony with nature. Two of these are the Boykos and the Hutsuls, very similar to a casual eye, but very different in folklore and history. Let's discover some interesting facts and curiosity about their culture to better prepare your visit for your next trip!\n\n### BOYKOS\n\n#### Boykos and their mysterious origins\n\nThe history of the Boykos is to this day a complete mystery. Many researchers and academics tried to trace back their origins, however without any success. A Croatian researcher called N. Klaich wrote that: “There has been more ink consumed than there are Boykos themselves.” Today, there are different theories about how they became the indigenous group, but some evidence might suggest that they could belong to the Croat Boii-Celts.\n\n#### Music and dance in everyday life\n\n![](image\u002F311)\n\nThe Kolomyika is the most popular form of Ukrainian folk ditty, consisting of two rhyming lines with a set rhythmic pattern. The Boykos' version is very particular, and it narrates of the community's everyday life, from family to social gatherings. Boykos love dancing and traditional dances are usually calmer and slower compared to the neighbouring indigenous communities. Stomping is very common in their dances as also holding one or two hands up in the air. [Dance here to their music](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=dLPxAzCDp7E)!\n\n#### Shy personality\n\nBoykos are also known to be very reserved and not very interested in a Mundane lifestyle, but they are so vivid when you get a chance to hang out with them. It is a matter of gaining your confidence to know your real kind personality.\n\n#### Hard workers\n\n![](image\u002F316)\n\nTheir connection with nature is powerful, mainly due to the presence of the enchanting Carpathian mountains that surround its villages. Boykos have a very high work ethic and are considered hard-working in the country. They are tireless farmers and ranchers, they also trade their artisanal food products, which are sold in other parts of Europe.\n\n#### Skilled Woodcarvers artists\n\nBoykos are known to be very skilled woodcarvers and woodworkers. Ancient ornamental motifs include linear elements, solar rosettes, and triangular shapes. Their modern wooden decorations on buildings are minimal and elegant, and it is common to see how impeccable their work is by looking at doors, window frames, columns and parapets in Boykos villages!\n\n#### Delicious cuisine\n\n![](image\u002F318)\n\nThe traditional cuisine of the Boykos is delicious, typical of the mountainous area. Tasty and nutritious plates to combat the cold. Potatoes are the main food, also known as \"second bread\" and are used to make many dishes such as dumplings stuffed with cottage cheese (Pirohía) or potato pancakes (Deruny). Mushrooms also play a fundamental role in their diet, as does the meat of their cattle. With all this and other ingredients, they cook delicious stews that you will never forget.\n\n### HUTSULS\n\n#### Hutsul culture and its influences\n\nHutsul culture in general, is influenced by that of the different countries in which the Hutsuls live and by other mountain peoples who share similar origins, particularly their songs and dances, as well as their clothing. For example, they stand out for sharing many characteristics with the traditional Romanian culture, influenced even more by these people than other regions of the west and south-west of Ukraine, as well as with the Górales in Poland and Slovakia, and the Moravian Wallachs in the Czech Republic.\n\n#### Symbolism and Fashion\n\n![](image\u002F317)\n\nImportant symbology can be seen on the traditional Hutsul clothing, which in the past used to have high sacral significance and have protective powers against evil spirits. Colours had great importance, and each colour had its meaning. Bright designs with red symbolize maturity, while green was the symbol of the birth of new opportunities. Geometric patterns also had their symbology: meander pattern was fertility, rhombus was Mother Earth, stars were the Faith, and a water snake was the symbol of water. Their Sorochka shirts are famous all over the world for their colourful patterns and would make an incredible statement piece in your wardrobe!\n\n#### The importance of celebrations\n\nHutsuls are known for throwing the best parties! The Trembita announces every important event in a Hutsul person, a wooden Hutsul horn around three meters in length, three centimetres wide at the mouthpiece, and eight centimetres at the end. The particular sound of the instrument, mostly if well played, intends to break the mountain silence and has excellent symbology.\n\n#### Hutsul pony\n\n![](image\u002F313)\n\nThey are credited with creating the breed of horses known as the Hutsul Pony, a species of small horses originally from the Carpathians with a sturdy build and excellent resistance. They are calm horses that are used to transport wood from inaccessible forest areas. They are usually black, brown or brown, with a dorsal stripe and also have lines on the legs.\n\n#### Hutsul music and dance\n\n![](image\u002F314)\n\nSinging is equally important, and the Hutsuls kolomyjkas are rich and known all over the country. These tend to be danced by six couples of women and men. But the most popular of all dances is the Hutsulka, a dozen people link arms in a circle and dance spinning faster and faster. Men can diversify by squatting down and coming right up very fast, all while singing and stomping the feet. The Arkan is the brigands' dance for which they stage a fight, featuring an attack, flight, and pursuit. Everything is accompanied by the Hutsul orchestras, which are loud and consisting of different traditional instruments such as, the Telenka (a hazelwood overtone flute), the Sopilka (a type of shepherd's flute) and the Fujara (a long flute).\n\n#### Entertaining weddings\n\nAn old say says that if you can survive a Hutsul wedding, you can survive anything! Weddings are incredibly elaborate and planned long ahead of the day and are divided into three parts: the pre-wedding, the wedding itself, and the after-wedding. If you happen to witness one, make sure to fully dive into the celebrations and be ready to party for three full days!\n\n#### Tradition, architecture and UNESCO World Heritage list\n\n![](image\u002F315)\n\nIn 2019 the tradition of Kosiv painted ceramics became officially part of the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The ceramics are made with local grey clay mixed with white clay, and they include dishes, ceremonial items, toys, and tiles. The decorations are painted over using a metal stick by scratching, then fired and painted with metal oxides. The designs and colours narrate the Hutsuls' history, life, folklore, beliefs, and customs. The communities well protect this art since it is the most significant part of their identity, and it is possible to master it thanks to classes at the Department of Art Ceramics of Kosiv College. Furthermore, at both the Hutsuls and Boykos it has been recognized as another UNESCO merit. Sixteen Tserkvas (churches) between Ukraine and Poland were included in the World Heritage List in 2013. These were built of horizontal wooden logs between the 16th and 19th centuries by communities of Orthodox and Greek Catholic faiths and represent the local tradition, symbolism, and the communities' spirituality.\n\nRead more about Boykos and Hutsuls in our tribes section.\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo “Festival of Ukrainian culture” iStock.com\u002F\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E[\u003Csup\u003ENataliia Yankovets\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002Fyankovets?mediatype=photography)",

                title: "How Some Indigenous Communities are Coping with COVID-19",
                text: "**How Indigenous peoples' Traditional Knowledge is saving lives.**\n\nThe year 2020 will always be remembered as the year of science and adjustment. Not only are we developing a new awareness of the importance of preserving the environment, but we also realized that scientific discovery is fundamental for the well-being of all terrestrial species.\n\nScience is necessary and helps save people lives without a doubt. Still, In the modern world, we tend to undervalue traditional knowledge, and putting aside the millennial wisdom that we have intrinsic within us. Traditional knowledge can help science by providing valuable solutions to new challenges\n\nAt Afribadger, we want to consider the pandemic as a watershed moment, allowing us to build a better, fairer and sustainable world in which the rights and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples are respected. Therefore, what happens when science and traditional knowledge come together and prove to be successful for the well-being of an entire community?\n\nLet's dive into some of the most successful initiatives around the globe to get inspiration from indigenous peoples’ wisdom!\n\n***\"Indigenous peoples are seeking their solutions to this pandemic taking action, and using traditional knowledge and practices such as voluntary isolation, and sealing off their territories, as well as preventive measures – in their languages.\"***\n\n\\[*COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples,* United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs conference.\\]\n\n#### Igorot and Karen tribes - Traditional self-isolation used to prevent infections.\n\n![](image\u002F321)\n\n***“Indigenous peoples continue to do what they have done for centuries—Adapting to change while maintaining their cultures and traditional ways of life. They are taking action and finding their own unique solutions during this global pandemic. Their resilience in overcoming these challenges serves as an inspiration to us all.”*** **Anne Nuorgam** (Chair, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues)\n\n\\[*COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples,* United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs conference.\\]\n\nSelf-isolation does not represent something new to Indigenous Peoples, and these practices are used to face off the last COVID-19 emergency.\n\n**Igorot** peoples of Luzon (Philippines) traditionally practice temporary self-isolation to protect their members in crisis periods or in case of a tragedy to recover the community spiritually and emotionally. *Ngilin* is the name used for quarantine: during this period, people are not allowed to make unnecessary movements or noises, and no one can enter or leave the community. More: in this period, cooperation and support are rules to be observed by every community member. Pudongs do the warning of *Ngilin* period, local trees placed at every entrance of the village, used to warn people that the area is off-limit.\n\nThe *Kroh yee* (village closure) is a similar practice existing among the **Karen** people of Thailand It’s a regular part of the ritual included in the sixth month of the lunar calendar: the *Kroh yee* can differ and be used during severe crises, as seventy years ago during a cholera outbreak.\n\n#### Indonesian **Iban Dayak** – Pro-active communities.\n\n![](image\u002F320)\n\nIn Indonesia, indigenous people numbered between 50 to 70 million. For the COVID-19 emergency, they have been among the most proactive communities. The **Iban Dayak** community of Sungai Utik, a Borneo island, live in one of Indonesia's last traditional longhouses characterized by dozens of family apartments and communal spaces. When news of the coronavirus arrived, the 150 longhouse residents immediately closed off access to outsiders and tourists as a way to prevent contagious diseases. This was possible considering that food was not an issue, because there’s still talented hunters and foragers in the community.\n\n#### India - Cooperation as the key to safety\n\n![](image\u002F323)\n\n*“As far as Indigenous peoples are concerned, they have tried their best using local medicines, setting up helping centers that are more dignified in the forest areas. They even conducted schooling and also exams. A lot of creative methods happened, even some of the good practices \\[…\\] some of the communities have decided to redistribute the lands so that people will not go back to the cities \\[…\\]”* **Gam Shimray** (Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact)\n\n\\[*COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples,* United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs conference.\\]\n\nIn India, which is considered to be in the middle of the next virus’ epicenter, communities are opening dialogue between villages and trying to help one another with fruitful cooperation. Many villages set up centres in the forest to help the ills and to assist the elderly during the pandemic, no matter their ethnic background. Furthermore, students are back to their home villages and are setting up schools for the children.\n\n**Amazonia – Indigenous coalitions and new approaches to traditional knowledge through Social Media**\n\n![](image\u002F319)\n\n“*Our indigenous elders are the guardians of history, traditions, languages and culture, and are particularly vulnerable. They deserve special attention to safeguard and prevent bioculture loss.*” **Anne Nuorgam** (Chair, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues)\n\n\\[*COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples,* United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs conference.\\]\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is desperately trying to protect their populations. Because of the lack of local Government's measures to protect the communities, the ethnocultural characteristics of these populations are at risk, and the indigenous peoples' main goal is to protect their elders. Elders are scared to reach for help in hospitals because of the general idea that health workers give priority care to younger people. Therefore, the **Waorani** people in Ecuador at the beginning of the pandemic started a legal process against the Ecuadorian Government, which was not taking enough precautions to protect the community of five thousand from the risk of cultural extermination. However, in June, they won the case, and they have been collaborating with indigenous coalitions and universities ever since. A medical brigade administered 150 rapid tests in the area, which was most hit by the virus, tracking symptoms and treating ill people.\n\nFurthermore, indigenous organizations and local communities have created interactive videos to explain the virus to people better, translated into five different Amazonian languages, and distributed to villages with access to social media. This initiative was carried out by the organizations without the help of any institution, and it was self-organized.\n\n#### Australia- The Government, protects Indigenous People and traditional Knowledge!\n\n![](image\u002F322)\n\nFrom the 11th of August 2020, the Australian State of the Northern Territory will be closed for 18 months. This was announced by Governor Michael Gunner, who added that additional police patrols would be deployed to ensure that the ordinance is observed. Gunner's drastic decision was made to protect the indigenous population who live in remote places and are much more vulnerable: “Territories first. This is what I think is right to do to make sure that some of the most vulnerable people in the world are safe.\"\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nCover photo Indigenous family, social distancing. iStock.com\u002Fgrandriver",

                title: "Madagascar, The Island of Friendly Indigenous Peoples",
                text: "#### Discover the Island\n\nMadagascar is a real heaven for nature lovers keen to go trekking! One first example: the Lokobe nature reserve is a protected area that shows the remains of the rainforest that previously covered the whole Island. The volcanic lakes are the perfect habitat for crocodiles, and the hills and mountains are the incredible backdrops of this unique place.\n\n![](image\u002F301)\n\nMore: there are approximately 950 hectares of Mangroves that host a rich community of crustaceans and mollusks. Here also lives the smallest frog and the smallest chameleon in the world! Even the state road has a high natural value: is known as the “Avenue des Baobab” and connects the municipality of Morondava with Belo Sur Tsiribinhina with it’s is 198 km length. It is known all over the world for the breath-taking Baobabs living along its path, which are centuries old and considered as a Natural Monuments. Moreover, UNESCO enlisted in the world's heritage list two of Malagasy natural patrimonies: the Rainforests of the Atsinanana and Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve. The bay of Antsianana is the second largest in the world.\n\n![](image\u002F303)\n\nThat said, if trekking is not your cup of tea, the Madagascan famous white sand beaches are worldwide recognized, and Nosy Be could be the right location for you.\n\nMadagascar, however, is not only famous for its outstretched white sand beaches and palms, lemurs, orchids, and baobab trees: it is also home to some of unique tribes in the world, with at least 18 different indigenous groups. Wrapped around legends, myths, and traditions, the Mikea, the Antandroy, and the Sakalava are part of the intangible heritage of this exceptional country. They are today the living memory of millennial traditions and the Madagascan folklore. In this article, you will learn some curiosities about these three tribes that you can visit with Afribadger and better prepare your trip!\n\n**Discover three Malagasy tribes. Folklore and Resilience to keep traditions alive.**\n\n#### MIKEA - The secret to life is hidden deep in the desert’s ground\n\n![](image\u002F299)\n\nMikea people, a group of Malagasy-speaking horticulturalists and foragers, inhabit the Mikea Forest, mixed spiny forest and dry deciduous forest area along the coast of southwestern Madagascar. Curious about Mikea way of life and their temperament? Let’s discover something together!\n\n- The Mikea people live in what is considered one of the most hostile environments in the world, a desert. Due to these conditions, they were sure they could live in peace; far away from cities and urbanization and continuing their traditional lifestyle**.**\n- \"Mikea\" literally means \"who doesn't want to be sued\". That is why The Mikea concept is a flight from modernity and its constraints. It's a rebellion against civilization.\n- During the 60s, researchers, and anthropologists tried to approach the communities, pushed by their curiosity, and encouraged by the numerous legends regarding them. They discovered friendly people that adapted entirely to the territory and the harsh weather. The Mikeas are known to be hunter-gatherers who have become breeders and farmers: every day, and they're going through about 10 km on foot for food.\n- Mikea people could go on for days (or even weeks!) without drinking any water, thanks to a yam called *Baboho*, which grows in the sand of this desert at 2 meters deep in the ground. These have plenty of water in them, and they are prepared in different ways from jelly jams or even raw, giving the hydration that the Mikea need to survive.\n- Music plays an important role both in their social and spiritual life. They still use traditional musical instruments such as the musical bow on the gourd, the seven-stick xylophone and the rattle.\n- The Mikeas are known to make masks, that is rare in Madagascar, using human teeth and hair. Quite scaring no?!\n\nRead more about Mikea tribe in our tribes section.\n\n#### ANTANDROY - Ancestors dictate the community’s laws and everyday life\n\n![](image\u002F300)\n\nThe Antandroy are a traditionally nomadic ethnic group of Madagascar inhabiting the arid southern part of the Island called Androy.\n\nThey are well known for their taboos called “*Fady*”, which are prohibitions imposed by the ancestors, but also the “*Fombas*”, obligations and traditional customs to follow to avoid insulting the ancestors. These can be considered as a sort of “laws” and moral values. Some Fady and Fombas are observed to this day, and it is common courtesy for visitors to follow them. Let's dive right in and discover some of the most curious ones that you can quickly adapt (and surprise your host family!)\n\n- Some specific places are considered fady: these are generally sacred, and it is forbidden to build on its ground.\n- Turtle isn't on an Antandroy menu, since eating them is considered insulting to the ancestors. Stories about why this is forbidden are numerous, and each community has its version! This also applies to snakes, cats, dogs, cows without horns, and onion.\n- Curiously enough, some fady apply to bananas. In some villages, the fruit is considered sacred. The legend states that a family found an abandoned baby sleeping in the trunk of a banana tree, floating down a river, and bringing luck to his adopting family.\n- Astronomy plays to this day a vital role to determine if a baby will be born on a lucky or unlucky day. Some babies have been abandoned in the past; however, this is not the custom anymore. Fady also applies to some weeks' days, Monday is usually a rest day.\n- Comparing someone to a dog is not only an insult but a potent \"fombas\". If someone compares a person to a dog, a cow will probably be sacrificed to cancel this insult.\n\nRead more about Antandroy tribe in our tribes section.\n\n#### SAKALAVA - Spirit possession to seek guidance\n\n![](image\u002F302)\n\nThe **Sakalava** are one of the smaller ethnic group of Madagascar, constituting about 6% of the total population. They live in the western and northwest region of the Island, in a band along the coast. Their name means \"people of the long valleys.\". What about their traditional customs?\n\n- The cult of possession started within the Sakalava monarchical systems is known as *Tromba.* The king had divine rights, had life and death powers over people together with healing powers. After death, he became even more powerful, as he was destined to return to his people through Tromba possession.\n- Today’s *Tromba*, are generally considered to be the work of an ancient ruler’s spirit possessing someone to bestow blessings, advice or remedies for diseases. Most frequently, the possessed are generally women, often single or with fertility issues. Usually the possession is preceded by a state of trance, or even it manifests itself through a dream. After these first signs, some public ceremonies are organised to allow the spirit to express itself. The possessed will be blessed and officially appointed by the village's medium to learn the use of medicinal plants.\n- Other ancient customs are called *\"Doanys\",* where bones of deceased kings of the Sakalava are kept. The mortal remains are brought back into the circle of the living in a ceremony called *Fitampoha*, the annual purification of a dynasty's sacred relics. Relics are washed in the river and brought back to Doany*.*\n- No surprise if Malagasy tombs are always better built than homes! The Sakalava tribe don't build tombs but bury in uniquely graves decorated with erotic wooden sculptures. They believe that, when the wood disintegrates the soul, is finally free to govern the living again.\n\nRead more about Sakalava tribe in our tribes section.\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Traditional fishing village, Madagascar\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n[\u003Csup\u003EiStock.com\u002Fvale\\_t\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E](http:\u002F\u002FiStock.com\u002Fvale_t)",

                title: "Discover Some of the Most Amazing Tribal Beauty Secrets",
                text: "Travelling with Afribadger is a life-changing experience that will allow you to discover remote cultures, with their traditions, their unique customs, their ancient beliefs, their incomparable habitats. When you have the opportunity to live one of our experiences, you will discover that surprisingly many times we have more things in common with other cultures than we think. One of them is beauty care.\n\nTaking care of one’s self has almost always been in human nature. Beauty is a concept that till this day is at the centre of different discussions and studies, proving that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder. For centuries Indigenous people have created their cosmetic products using minerals, oils and plants harvested from their local natural resources. Many ingredients in modern-day beauty and makeup products such as jojoba in face moisturiser, Aloe Vera for makeup removers or Yucca for firming facial serums were discovered by them hundreds of years ago.\n\nNowadays, the Indigenous beauty secrets of ancestors are useful. Thus, Native elders skincare or cosmetic products cannot be missing in our makeup bags. Not only these secrets have been proved and demonstrated to be effective after centuries of use, but these also show the resilience of the populations to work with natural resources and to still take care of themselves.\n\nThese secrets are so precious today more than ever. Especially if we consider today’s society, in which all the products we use on our bodies are generally reviewed, suggested and often coming from far away and delivered at our doorstep thanks to the click of a button.\n\n**But, what means to take care of oneself in hostile environments like deserts, rainforests and desert islands? Let’s discover together some of the Indigenous beauty secrets from different corners of the world and the reasons behind them!**\n\n#### Berbers - Beauty secrets from North Africa\n\n![](image\u002F293)\n\nBerber women of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia or Libya have a memorable tradition of using natural beauty remedies. Here are some examples and beauty advice to keep in mind.\n\n**Argan oil for skin and hair beauty** Is a plant oil produced from the kernels of the Argan tree, mostly grown in Morocco. Used in both culinary and beauty products, is high in Vitamin E offering restorative and age-defying effects. It’s packed with antioxidants and good for skin, hair and nails.\n\n**Rosewater as a high-performance skin toner** This beauty secret has been used by Berber women and is almost immediately effective. It can be used as an after-sun product, toner, makeup remover, moisturiser and a balm for eczema.\n\n**Savon Beldi and Kessa mitt for hammam ritual** This Moroccan soap is the core of a traditional North African hammam ritual. Its exfoliating, nourishing and moisturising properties make it a favourite skin-enhancing beauty product. It has to be paired with a Kessa glove to get the best results.\n\n**Kohl: ancient smokey eye makeup** It is used as the perfect product to create smoky eyes. Few people know that Kohl is beneficial for the eyes: it cleans the eye surface and stimulates eyelash growth.\n\n**Henna for hair and body** It’s made out of dried plants that produce various shades of dye. Berber women used to decorate their body with henna during weddings and celebrations. Henna has great health benefits for the hair too, promoting hair growth and maintaining the natural sheen of the hair.\n\n#### Myanmar - Sandalwood paste, a versatile beauty ingredient.\n\nIn Myanmar, indigenous women use a local type of sandalwood bark that’s ground into a white paste, called *Thanaka*, to wear on their faces to protect their skin from the sun. Apart from its protective action, this product is also used for facial decoration, applying it in several patterns. The paste smells good and more than this; it has a purifying and anti-acne effect too.\n\n#### Peru - Mineral-infused pink salt is a bathing essential\n\n![](image\u002F295)\n\nIn Peru, local markets are full of oils and nuts from the jungle. Between all these products, there’s a kind of local salt belonging to Andean highlands that was first mined by the Incas, used since years by the ancestors because it is considered very beneficial for health. Today women use the salts, which are high in several minerals, as scrubs and for bathing obtaining desirable results. Seeing is believing!\n\n#### Mongolian nomads - Yogurt beauty secret\n\n![](image\u002F292)\n\nHave you ever thought of yoghurt as a beauty product? In rural Mongolia, where a nomadic way of life still predominates, certain beauty and cultural practices are still intact. Homemade yoghurt is used on the face to help brighten the skin. The yoghurt comes from the milk produced by cows, reindeers and goats that graze on open land, treated and conserved in a natural way and without any pesticides. A more fermented yoghurt is also applied to the skin to treat acne and reduce skin inflammation.\n\n#### Madagascar - Nature’s SPF\n\n![](image\u002F296)\n\nSakalava and Vezo women wear natural SPF on their faces daily, which is believed to be the secret to their beautiful skin. The paste called Masonjaony is made from the grounded bark of wood with added water, resulting in a thick cream. This mask not only protects from the UV\u002FUVA damages, but it repels mosquitos and works as a natural exfoliate too. The flowery designs are added to embellish the girl’s face, and it is its unique characteristic!\n\n#### Himbas - Makeup is in the soil\n\n![](image\u002F297)\n\nHimbas are well known for their intricate body embellishments and beauty customs. The most characteristic tradition is the initiation of a woman to the red-painted hair and body once entered into puberty. The red hair can incorporate animal fur or plants, and it becomes more and more elaborate as she grows up. The paste used is called Otjize, which is a type of clay mixed with water, and applied to the hair, body and face, each morning, and it helps to attract attention. The Otjize is also a natural insect repellent and a sun protector.\n\n#### Sudanese and Somali Indigenous communities - Natural perfume, smelling like the Goddesses\n\nThe beauty custom of some of the Sudanese women is called dukhan, which means ‘smoke’ in Arabic, is a particular tradition believed to give the skin a slight tan, get rid of joint problems and arthritis. It consists of burning a few pieces of charcoal, putting them in a small container on the ground, adding some elements of acacia bark and sandalwood (which gives it its particular scent), and finally sitting on a chair or crouching above the pot covered in a blanket. This sort of “tent” allows the smoke to warm up the lower body working its magic. This ritual is performed at least once a week by many married women and goes back thousands of years to.\n\nSimilar to this practice is the ‘Uunsi’ done by Somali women. It consists of sugar resin, frankincense and oils added to the coal. The smoke has a very intense perfume which can last for different days on the skin. Furthermore, the Somali housewife usually wears Huruud (turmeric), Qasil and Oils on her face as a mask, which serves as a natural exfoliator and also as a natural “highlighter” for the skin. Henna is common on both hair and hands, with intricate designs. Dates are usually transformed into Ghee and used all over the body, hair and use as a face mask. The Basara Arab women of Chad have harvested themselves the ingredients that are later on transformed into oils or powders and applied to their beautiful hair, to keep them hydrated and shiny.\n\n#### Yao tribe - The secret to the longest hair on earth\n\n![](image\u002F294)\n\nThe Yao women have some of the most incredible hair in the word, and it is considered their most prized possession, and the reason why the “Long Hair Village” where they live, is even recognised by the Guinness world book of records as the “world’s longest hair village”. Usually, hair grows up to 2.1 meters (6.8 feet) long, as it symbolises longevity, wealth and good fortune. The shampoo used is fermented rice full of antioxidants, minerals, vitamins. Once cooked the rice, they leave it to cool down at room temperature for a day, to ferment it, and then they rinse their hair carefully with it.\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nRead more about these cultures in our tribes section.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Hmba couple iStock.com\u002F\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E[**\u003Csup\u003Enicolamargaret\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002Fnicolamargaret?mediatype=photography)",

                text: "The COVID-19 Pandemic had significantly impacted the business world, especially the Tourism Industry globally, due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travellers. Like all business, Afribadger continues to monitor the international situation generated by this pandemic and assess and examine the daily developments to come over the devastating effects. However, we look to the future with optimism.\n\nAlthough we see some countries started to reopen their borders, there are strict travel measures in place; from 15-days quarantine upon arrival, the performance of PCR tests as well as the use of masks onboard plans. More so, most governments continue to advise their nationals to avoid nonessential international travel; These measures have also played a pillar element in delaying travel plans.\n\n**While our goal is to restore travel experiences safely for our travellers and indigenous tribes, It is essential for us to KEEP PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST!**\n\nWe continue to work on creating safety regulations with our allies and local partners, to be able to offer itineraries free of any health risk.\n\nWe know that members of our community are adventurers and miss being able to live life-changing experiences alongside the world's most incredible indigenous tribes. Still, for now, we have to remain patient and make sure our trips are not going to be a risk for the communities visited or for our Nomadis.\n\nAs our business model is unique and our offering to travellers require us to also look after the health and safety of tribe members of Indigenous communities; we are also observing International organisations' processes and analysis on this matter. We are fully committed to adhering to measures and steps that ensure the safety of Indigenous communities.\n\nAt Afribadger, we continue to navigate through the tough time, working towards better and safer lifetime experiences for our travellers and tribes.\n\nMeanwhile, our platform [nomadictribe.com](https:\u002F\u002Fnomadictribe.com\u002F) continues to be a fantastic online community for like-minded travellers to explore, connect and learn about different tribe cultures and rituals and equip themselves with the right knowledge. And we will continue building new experiences so when the time comes, travellers can book life-changing journeys that let you encounter authentic indigenous cultures.\n\nAfribadger TEAM",

                text: "Afribadger is committed to responsible and environmentally sustainable tourism, following the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN, targeting more specifically Goal 13 “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.\n\nAfribadger upholds that Indigenous Peoples manage a third of global forests and they are the leading stewards of our environment. Their role is fundamental in the global curbing of gas emissions and they protect around 80% of the world’s biodiversity, however they are the first victims of climate change.\n\nThis is why it is imperative for Afribadger to take action on climate change and reduce the carbon emissions generated by our company and our travellers to further protect Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Knowledge.\n\nOur travels are designed to respect the values of responsible tourism and sustainable development. We commit to become a carbon neutral Company, fighting against climate change. We intend to reduce our emissions through ecological strategies, maintaining our carbon neutrality by reducing and seeking less carbon-intensive solutions.\n\n![](image\u002F274)\n\nWe’ve signed up to [**Tourism Declares**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.tourismdeclares.com\u002F), an initiative that supports tourism businesses, organisations and individuals in declaring a climate emergency and taking purposeful action to reduce their carbon emissions as per the advice from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to cut global carbon emissions to 55% below 2017 levels by 2030.\n\n#### Like all signatories, we have committed to the following five actions:\n\n1\\. Develop a ‘Climate Emergency Plan’ within the next 12 months, which sets out our intentions to reduce carbon emissions over the next decade.\n\n2\\. Share an initial public declaration of our ‘Climate Emergency Plan’, and update on progress each year.\n\n3\\. Accept current IPCC advice stating the need to cut global carbon emissions to 55% below 2017 levels by 2030 in order to keep the planet within 1.5 degrees of warming. We’ll ensure our ‘Climate Emergency Plan’ represents actions designed to achieve this as a minimum, through delivering transparent, measurable and increasing reductions in the total carbon emissions per customer arising from our operations and the travel services sold by us.\n\n4\\. Encourage our suppliers and partners to make the same declaration; sharing best practice amongst peers; and actively participate in the Tourism Declares community\n\n5\\. Advocate for change. We recognise the need for system change across the industry, and call for urgent regulatory action to accelerate the transition towards zero carbon air travel.\n\n**Please consider also declaring at** [**Tourism Declares**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.tourismdeclares.com\u002F)**, and follow on @tourismdeclares on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin**",

                title: "Trekking the High Atlas Mountains With the Berber Tribe (Amazigh) in Morocco",
                text: "[\u003Csup\u003EAn article\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E](https:\u002F\u002Ftravelfreak.com\u002Ftrekking-atlas-mountains\u002F)\u003Csup\u003E by Jeremy Scott Foster\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E.\n\nIt’s the first night in the guesthouse, high in the Atlas Mountains, and there are seven of us crammed into a room with sleeping bags. We’re all on the floor—no beds—sharing a room in someone’s home.\n\nAnd then it dawns on me: I’m already disrespecting the culture.\n\nIn Muslim cultures, unmarried men and women aren’t supposed to sleep in the same room. And here I am, on day *one*, at a Berber household in a village in the mountains of Morocco, doing just that.\n\nAnd they allow it.\n\nWhat the heck? Is just being here a huge mistake? After years of living in hostels, sharing a room with friends of every gender is unthinkably normal to me, but the seven of us are violating their cultural norms in a pretty big way.\n\nHave I already disobeyed the first rule of responsible travel?\n\nThe next morning, a few hours into our trek, I’m chatting with my guide—a local Moroccan who grew up in these villages—about the people and the culture. I’m *filled* with curiosity. Suddenly he stops, quietly observing the mountains before him, and then turns to me and says, “I’m just glad you’re here. Most people don’t even think to ask these questions.”\n\nAnd, in that moment, all my doubts vanish.\n\n![](image\u002F270)From then on, it was as if a door had been opened. There was space for discourse. Once we broke the silence by vocalizing the awkward questions we all harbored, we were able to engage in authentic conversations about what it means to travel sustainably, especially in regards to this trip.\n\nEspecially in regards to visiting local tribes and how best to create meaningful experiences through travel without changing or harming the local way of life.\n\nWe talked about our culture and theirs, our different life experiences, and all the things we take for granted. We talked about money matters, where it goes, how much the tribes get from hosting us, and how it benefits them.\n\nWe talked about what it actually means to travel sustainably, especially when it comes to protecting indigenous cultures.\n\nWhen Afribadger asked me to join them on their [5-day hiking trip in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains](https:\u002F\u002Fnomadictribe.com\u002Ftribes\u002Fthe-berber-amazigh\u002Ftrips) with the local Berber tribes, I had a *lot* of questions before I agreed to tag along. And they honestly didn’t have all the answers, because, quite frankly, I don’t think anybody does.\n\nSustainable travel is incredibly complex and nuanced. And anybody who’s willing to admit they don’t have all the answers—but are working to figure it out—gets a gold star in my book.\n\n#### ![](image\u002F269)\n\n#### Who is Afribadger?\n\nAfribadger is an app-based community for travelers in search of life-changing journeys through interactions with indigenous cultures.\n\nThey’re a social network, information platform and OTA all rolled into one. Once you decide what country or tribe you want to visit, they’ll connect you with a vetted local guide for the ultimate local experience.\n\nAfribadger subscribes to the [UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for Tourism](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.unwto.org\u002Fglobal-code-of-ethics-for-tourism), and they follow this code closely.\n\nLast year they invited me to Morocco to trek ~60 miles through the Atlas Mountains, staying in Amazigh villages along the way. You might know the Amazigh as the “Berbers,” but here’s your first lesson: “Berber” is actually considered to be a derogatory term because, linguistically, it stems from the word “barbarian.”\n\nWe used the names interchangeably throughout the trip, as the word “Berber” has been so deeply implanted in our brains, and it’s something we fought and struggled with on a daily basis. Trying to reframe our perspective and speech patterns was more difficult a task than we thought it would be.\n\n#### Who Are the Amazigh?\n\nThe Amazigh tribes have roamed the Atlas Mountains and all over Morocco since 2,000 BCE. While on the move they farmed, traded, and lived off the land to provide their livestock with food, shelter, and water. They collect plants to use for dyes, which is why you see intricate and colorful textiles all over the country.\n\nDespite being semi-nomadic, the Amazigh tribes *do* have permanent villages they call home. And this is how I became acquainted with some tribes and their way of life.\n\nIf you want a sustainable travel experience with indigenous tribes, you need to ask a lot of hard questions, and you’re probably not going to always get it right. So here are some things to consider.\n\n#### How Do I Participate in Indigenous Culture While Still Being Respectful?\n\nBefore my trip, I wanted to know what kind of experiences I’d be having, and how I’d be actively engaged with the tribe. There’s a fine balance between asserting yourself into a culture and respectfully engaging in it.\n\nAmazigh tribes are nomadic, and so it makes sense that my trip involved lots of walking every day…and it wasn’t always—okay, it was *never*—a stroll in the park. Sometimes I’d start out on a fairly flat plain before ascending hours into the hills. But with views like this over the High Atlas Mountains, it was worth it.\n\n#### How Do I Participate in Indigenous Culture While Still Being Respectful?\n\nBefore my trip, I wanted to know what kind of experiences I’d be having, and how I’d be actively engaged with the tribe.

Sometimes I’d start out on a fairly flat plain before ascending hours into the hills. But with views like this over the High Atlas Mountains, it was worth it.\n\n#### ![](image\u002F268)\n\n#### How Much Money Goes to the Local Tribe?\n\nIf you’re going to be dishing out to participate in a sustainable tour, you’re probably going to want to know just how much of that money goes back to the local tribes.\n\nYou’ll want to know how much of a cut the organization takes, and the tour guide, and the families or communities.\n\nCompanies should be completely transparent about this, and if they’re not, you’ll know something is up. In Afribadger’s case, it varies based on the duration of the experience, but on this trip to Morocco, 30% of the tour cost goes to the local villages.\n\nAcross all their trips, Afribadger donates an average of 25% of the tour cost.\n\nAfribadger only partners with local operators that are closely related with the tribes and based in the destination. In some cases, the owners even belong to the tribes. They are people that have had the chance to study and create their own small business and help their communities.\n\nIn that case, most of the cost of the trip stays local and helps the tribes and their surroundings while helping to avoid exploitation and mass tourism.\n\nOn top of this, during your trip, you’ll also have the opportunity to buy local and support indigenous craftwork. On one of my final days in Morocco, I visited imi Ourmer where the local women’s cooperative has perfected the art of making rugs.\n\nYou know, those famous Berber rugs? This is where they come from (if they’re real, anyway).\n\n![](image\u002F273)In Amazigh culture, art usually has some sort of functional purpose beyond just something to admire and look at, whether it’s jewelry, pottery, furniture, or a carpet, and certain designs are attributed to certain areas or tribes.\n\nFor example, Kilims (carpets or tapestries or rugs) are always made with traditional designs and motifs. A tribe from one region may use geometric designs like diamonds and triangles while another might use a completely different aesthetic.\n\nWant to contribute to an Amazigh village’s economy? Purchase that rug. Not only are you supporting the people, you’re going home with a real, authentic, one-of-a-kind piece of art that you’d probably pay upwards of $300 for at IKEA.\n\n#### What Will the Tribe do With That Money?\n\nA good tour company should have no problem telling you how the tribe spends the money they earn. Does it go towards healthcare, or better infrastructure, or food security?\n\nThere is a lot of nuance that goes along with paying local tribes. With a new income stream, they might be earning more than they ever did previously. But does the tribe know how to manage their finances? Is there a guarantee they’ll spend the money appropriately on things that are truly needed for the community and not extraneous commodities?\n\nDo we have the right to tell them where their money should go, and make it a condition that they only receive the money if they spend it on certain things? That’s us—an outside culture—influencing the local culture.\n\nWhat kind of cultural preservation is that?\n\n![](image\u002F267)In my opinion, it always has to start with a conversation with the tribes. Asking them what they need, and helping them to get it or build it, is the best way to help. That way, we’re not imposing our ideals onto them, but instead assisting them with things like access to clean water, buying more livestock, or other things that will improve the overall wellbeing of the community without watering down their way of life.\n\nWhat’s more, some tribes are so close to cultural extinction, the money received from these tours provides an income so they can literally just survive while maintaining and preserving their ancestral traditions.\n\nIf they don’t have incomes they will be forced to move to urban settlements, which is already happening. This is fine, of course, if it’s their own decision, but not acceptable if they want to keep living as their ancestors did.\n\nSome tribe members want to live in a more modern way, but many don’t. That makes this even more complicated.\n\n#### So, How Do We Preserve the Culture While Actively Participating in It?\n\nWhat happens after a couple of years when the locals are so used to foreigners visiting their villages they’re hardly considered “exotic” anymore?\n\nHow do we ensure that a culture doesn’t get watered down after years of “performing” for travelers?\n\nWhat’s more, who are we to say it’s our responsibility to preserve that culture in the first place? Surely, it’s entirely up to the tribe.\n\nRight?\n\nThese questions are some of the most difficult to ask. But I loved Afribadger’s approach to the issues. Instead of shuttling in big buses full of tourists, they’re bringing small groups and encouraging interaction and immersion—not just observation.\n\nWhen you’re contributing financially to these tribes, you’re directly helping to preserve the culture. If you buy a rug, you’re helping to sustain that age-old craft that is so deeply rooted in the culture. You’re aiding in the continuation of carpet making and helping to put food on the table.\n\nThat’s not to say you should pat yourself on the back for your good work, but your presence and contribution definitely offers an incentive.\n\n#### Can I Avoid Exploitation?\n\nWhat are your intentions with your visit? Are you eager to actually learn about Amazigh people, or are you simply seeking your next Instagram-worthy shot?\n\nDuring my visit, I tried to snap a photo of an Amazigh woman baking bread. She quickly waved me off, a little angrily, and my guide had to step in to explain that a woman may decide not to allow her photo to be taken, and you’ll have to respect that choice. It’s just the way it is.\n\nAnd this became a common theme. 99% of the time, women will not allow you to take their photo. Some did, and I captured some wonderful moments, but it was a good reminder to put my camera away and fully immerse myself in the experience.\n\nIf you are interacting with local people anywhere in the world, just remember that these are real people with real lives. You need to respect their boundaries and their homes. Leave no trace. The goal is to give back to their communities without disrupting their lifestyle.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nBottom line: there is nothing black or white about participating in indigenous tourism in a sustainable way. The most important thing is to ask yourself—and any tour operator—these difficult questions. Think about them, and consider all the possibilities.\n\nIf you feel like you’re doing more harm than good in visiting an indigenous tribe, then don’t do it.\n\nAll of these experiences are learning tools to help you better understand and respect some of the oldest cultures and countries in the world. It’s a beautiful thing to be able to pass this knowledge on to others.\n\nI loved that Afribadger connected me to local guides on the ground, and that I knew where all my money was going. Their heads and hearts were in the right place, so I decided to join them.\n\nIf you do choose to go [this route](https:\u002F\u002Fnomadictribe.com\u002Ftribes\u002Fthe-berber-amazigh\u002Ftrips), you’ll have the experience of a lifetime. Breaking bread and sipping tea with an Amazigh family while hiking through dramatic landscape views of the Atlas Mountains?\n\nWorth every penny you spend.\n\nJEREMY SCOTT FOSTER\n\n***\u003Csup\u003EJeremy Scott Foster\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E****\u003Csup\u003E is a travel photographer, blogger, and professional adventurer.

                text: '#### LEARN ABOUT INDIGENOUS FASHION, TRADITIONS AND COSTUMES STARTING FROM THEIR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE.\n\nAcross the world, in indigenous communities, the act of clothing the body had a strong socio-political meaning. Clothes made of all materials were the demonstration of someone\'s identity and status, often differentiating leaders from commoners, and nudity wasn\'t much of a problem. Tribal textile art is one of the most prominent indigenous artistic elements. Usually, the creation of intricate designs on traditional dresses is to depict someone\'s social status within the community, or they can be just ornamental.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Europeans and other populations, most traditional religions and beliefs were replaced, and some tribal clothing started being considered inappropriate and condemned by puritans for their peculiarities, and unfortunately, some disappeared.\n\nDepending on the tribe, designs can represent legends, stories, have protective powers against evil spirits, and communicate something important visually. Today, many communities are trying to preserve strong traditional manufacturing, keeping alive the practice despite the rising globalization and the westernization of fashion.\n\nLet\'s explore some of the fascinating textile art around the globe, the meaning behind the designs, and some exciting curiosities!\n\n#### OCEANIA - *Nature’s gifts for fashion style.*\n\n![](image\u002F263)\n\nThe warm weather in oceanic countries dictates that clothes are more of a burden than useful; this also contributes that some cultures have a strong body decoration tradition. It is not unusual to see tattoos or natural dyes applied on the skin, either to cover the skin or to protect from insects.\n\nNow, it is possible to see some traditional clothes, often worn during special occasions; This is the case of some of the Pacific Ocean island communities using the **Tapa**, incredible bark cloth used in everyday life, however pretty fragile if wet.\n\nIn Polynesia the production of Tapa is widespread, most specifically the islands of Samoa, Tonga, Hawaii, and Tahiti. Tapa manufacturing has many different designs and methods of production based on their country of origin.\n\nNatural vegetable dyes are usually light brown, red, and black and the decorations are printed on the cloth by stamping, rubbing, or even by smoking the fabric. Each pattern has different meanings and symbolism, depending on the Island. The process of fabrication is very intricate and lengthy. The main material is extracted by the paper mulberry tree, a common plant on the islands. After stripping long and large pieces of the tree\'s bark, the inner bark is scraped off and let dry in the sun, then soaked in water and lastly beaten to make it thinner.\n\nThis process is often a work reserved for the village\'s women, who are also the artists behind the cloths intricate decorations. If you want to learn more about the process of making Tapa, and hear the characteristic sound of the women tapping the fabric, [watch this video!](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=o1wFRzp05qk)\n\n#### SOUTH AMERICA and CENTRAL AMERICA - *Fashion to express emotions and symbology.*\n\n![](image\u002F262)\n\nVibrant colours of the indigenous populations living in Southern and Central America are known all over the world and admired by many. They are very popular that today many indigenous communities are suing some famous multinational clothing retailers for stealing indigenous designs and mass-producing their patterns, some of which are now protected by intellectual property rights.\n\nWith a millennial tradition of wool and cotton weaving, Andean indigenous populations are leaders of indigenous textiles keeping alive Quechua and Aymara designs. Alpacas, Vicunas, and llamas are the precious providers of the main material, woven using techniques that include dyeing, knotting, and plaiting. The history of Andean textiles is very ancient, and most stretches date thousands of years ago, carrying with themselves ancestral beliefs, traditions, myths, and giving us a hint of the pre-Columbian cultures.\n\nThe colourful designs are the silent representatives of the indigenous communities\' history, and to this day textiles are the predominant art form of some villages. Clothing features geometric humans, felines, reptiles figures, and hybrid animals in bold colours.\n\nIn Mexico, the **Huichol** indigenous community is well known for its incredible holistic connection with the arts, a principal way to express their emotions. The complicated designs of their famous embroideries represent their gods and the sacredness of nature. Many peyote visions are translated into these designs which can be found on the clothes and everyday objects as well.\n\n![](image\u002F266)\n\nThe **Kuna** (or Guna) people in Panama are renowned for the traditional "molas", cloth panels with intricate depictions often used to make the blouses of the traditional dress. These are colourful fabrics made with the techniques of appliqué and reverse appliqué.\n\n![](image\u002F260)\n\n**Mayan** women in Guatemala are so proud of their traditional embroideries that gained international attention in the past couple of years when they founded a popular movement against gender inequality and asked the Constitutional Court to protect indigenous fabrics under the Constitution against industrial mass production.\n\n#### AFRICA - *Raffia palm leaves and mud used to create unique fabrics.*\n\n![](image\u002F259)\n\nAn entire encyclopedia could be spent talking about African tribal fabrics! In this short presentation, we will focus on two: the Kuba and the Bogolan.\n\n**Kuba textiles** are unique in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the complexity of the design and surface decoration. Kuba people are agriculturalists and a cluster of the larger Bantu. Kuba cloth is handwoven using the strands from raffia palm leaves dyed in a variety of earth tones using vegetable dyes, particularly distinctive and evocative of central Africa. In Kuba culture, men are responsible for both raffia palm cultivation and weaving of raffia cloth, while women are in charge of the application of surface decoration at the end of the entire process. Men produce the fabric on inclined, single-heddle looms. The cloth is coarse when it is first cut from the loom, then pounded in a mortar, which softens it and prepares it for the application of decoration. Kuba cloths display a variety of interesting features: patchwork, embroidery, appliqué and embellishments.\n\nHistorically, the Kuba people have used their clothes as skirts, wrappers or sleeping mats. Suggestion for amateurs: Kuba cloths make wonderful wallhangings and soft furnishing. [See this exciting exhibition.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=z8-BKQtuNig)\n\nThe **Bogolan**, meaning mud cloth, is one of Africa\'s most unusual and unique textiles. The technique is associated with several ethnic groups from Mali, for example Dogon. Still, the Bambaran version is the one that has become better known internationally. In the Bambara language, the word "bògòlanfini" is a compound of bɔgɔ, which means "earth" or "mud"; lan, means "with" or "through"; and Fini, which means "cloth". The whole cloth is composed by narrow strips of handwoven cotton stitched together and then painted with patterns and symbols using several natural dyes, including river mud aged up to one year. These clothes are entirely handwoven, so that the thickness and weight are variable and imprecise: this makes each fabric unique. Want to see more about this fabric and technique?

Traditionally, Hmong embroidery is used as decoration on clothing, to make it bright and beautiful. It includes particular bright colours such as pinks, greens, reds as well as blues, sometimes used in contrast with the colours of yellow and brown overlaid with white. Starting from a young age, Hmong girls learn how to draw and design motifs from their mothers and grandmothers. Most traditional forms of Hmong textiles were made with hand-spun hemp (a species of cannabis) fabric. Hemp would be grown in small family or community farming plots until the plants were ready to be harvested and processed by Hmong women. The plants would be first dried in the sun, and the fibrous outermost layer of the plant stalk would be stripped and separated into short lengths of fibre to create an appropriate material for weaving. The coarse hemp fabric is produced by hand using a large wooden loom. [See traditional techniques, decorations, symbols and superstitions here!](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=YuTeHjOSyh8.)\n\n![](image\u002F261)\n\nThe second fabric that we want to present is related to the Ifugao tribe, part of the **Igorot** leading group. At Kiangan, the birthplace of Ifugao, **weaving** has always been a part of the community\'s daily activities because of commercial purposes, cultural preservation or personal use. The Ifugaos of Kiangan either practices traditional weaving which follows traditional techniques passed on through generations, or the *ikat*, where bundles of yarn are tightly wrapped together and dyed as many times to create a specific pattern or design. The patterns used are mostly traditional ones, mostly inspired by nature and beliefs. The bayawak pattern, for example, is based on an eponymous giant lizard said to be one of the gods who came down to earth to teach natives water irrigation. At the same time, the star symbol represents abundance, multitude, and fertility. Quezon City is another well-known centre of weaving and the core of Kalinga Province. Kalinga people are, as well, part of the leading Igorot group. Learn something about how to mix past and future to preserve weaving tradition and translate it in contemporary art, starting from the [suggestions of an incredible Kalinga woman.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=yUE0X4e7iL4)\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Inca woman weaving alpaca wool iStock.com\u002FFG Trade\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                text: "The Hunza Valley in Pakistan is the home to a community of people said to survive longer than anyone on Earth. So, what are the their health secrets to longevity?\n\nThe secluded Hunza people have an average life expectancy of 100 years old and exceeding 120 years in some cases. Meanwhile, the average life expectancy in Pakistan is only 67 years.\n\nIt is a fact that their isolation and quality of life have some interesting characteristics that would certainly make one healthier. The Hunza are said to be able to bear children later than usual, never getting sick, and being impervious to cancer. While there may be validity to some of these claims, others might be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nOne website states that Hunza women can conceive between the ages of 60 and 90 – a claim most women would find incredibly hard to believe. Another common belief is that the Hunza are all descendants of Alexander the Great, who left men too weak to continue on treks through the mountains during the Greek’s conquests in the fourth century BCE.\n\n![](image\u002F171)\n\nWhile the former claim sounds exaggerated, there is a possibility that the Hunza could be descendants of an Indo-European race that settled in the area. We’ll come back to this later on.\n\nThe Hunza Valley is situated in a remote, pristine area of northern Pakistan, where locals grow their own food and utilize fresh glacier water for drinking and bathing. Cut-off from any nearby cities or commercial hubs, the Hunza do not consume any processed foods and eat a diet rich in vegetables, milk, grains and fruit, especially apricots.\n\nApricots are a staple for the Hunza, who are said to go for several months a year on a diet consisting purely of apricot juice. The Hunza are said to not suffer from cancer, due to their consumption of vitamin b-17, also known as amygdalin, found in apricot seeds. Their diet also consists largely of raw fruits and vegetables, and lesser quantities of meat.\n\nThere are certain areas of the world, known as Blue Zones, with high concentrations of centenarians and longer life expectancies. Though the Hunza aren’t included on that list, they share some similar characteristics with Blue Zone denizens. Much like the Blue Zones, the Hunza live in an area of high elevation, where many work physically strenuous jobs, keeping them in peak physical shape, while breathing clean, fresh air.\n\nWhether the Hunza longevity is exaggerated, is up for debate, but what is undoubtedly that they lead a healthy life.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n*Plan your trip to visit the Hunza in our Tribes section.*",

                title: "How Indigenous Music Influences Current Contemporary Music Trends",
                text: "For many Indigenous communities around the globe, music is an essential part of the village's daily life as well as the main protagonist during celebrations of spiritual, cultural, and kinship rituals.\n\nScience proved that music helps the brain dealing with pain reduction, stress relief, memory, and brain injuries. It can have a powerful effect on our mood and can change our perceptions of the world and our situations.\n\nAlmost all of the known Indigenous populations have found the need to play music and create sounds; and, contemporary instruments like drums, flutes, and rattles differ depending on the continent and are all legacy of traditional music. Usually, chants or songs are passed from generation to generation, and many current songs contain the same tunes that were played thousands of years ago. More recently, new musical movements are trying to combine contemporary music styles like pop, rock, country, and hip-hop with traditional music, also incorporating other cultural aspects like traditional languages.\n\nThe assortment of music influences and movements varies, and it is impossible to examine all the musical traditions and groups. However, we will be looking at a few current contemporary indigenous music groups examples, considering different countries!\n\n#### NIGER - Tuareg Music Becomes Electric\n\nIn the Tuareg tradition, the ownership of songs and poems is collective. While performers always recognize the original songwriter, they are free to embellish and add verses to the song or poem. This way, poems, and songs document the past, but they are also a living history, which grows and changes with the experiences lived by the Tuareg. This collection of oral history is a rich source for the study of Tuareg culture and identity. One of the leading exponents of contemporary Tuareg music is Bombino, a pseudonym for Goumar Almoctar, a Nigerian guitarist and composer of the Tuareg ethnic group. Inspired by popular music from his homeland and by some rock legends like Jimi Hendrix and Mark Knopfler, he started his career as a very young musician, and today he is an internationally recognized artist. Check out one of his impressive [live performance](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Adfb17JQYtg).\n\n#### NIGERIA - Afrobeat: a combination of influences\n\n![](image\u002F169)\n\nAfrobeat is a genre of pop music born in West Africa in the second half of the 1960s and became particularly popular in the 1980s. It combines elements of traditional Yoruba (one of the main Nigerian tribes) music, jazz, funk, and other styles. The greatest exponent of the afrobeat was the Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, Fela Kuti. Among the other exponents, Femi Kuti, Tony Allen, and Antibalas. [Here a performance by Tony Allen](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=oCBpJkG6ngE), great contemporary musician, died in April 2020.\n\n#### ITALY - The beauty of mixing music traditional cultures\n\n![](image\u002F174)\n\nA stunning example of a multicultural orchestra in which ancient, indigenous cultures come together to create a \"unique\" is the Orchestra of Piazza Vittorio. The Orchestra was born in 2002 on the drive of artists, intellectuals, and cultural operators with the desire to enhance the homonymous Piazza dell' Esquilino in Rome, par excellence the multi-ethnic district of the city. Since then, the Orchestra has presented a different reality that finds its reason in the mixture of textual and musical languages, strongly believing that mixing culture produces beauty. This is an effort to keep different continents together, with their culture, their sounds, and their history. From 2002 to today, over 100 musicians from different geographic areas and very different musical fields have met, creating creative and professional projects. Lull yourself by [this mixture of sounds](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Kx0zXVPRTRM)\n\n#### SOUTH AFRICA - The joy of Xhosa music\n\n![](image\u002F168)\n\nXhosa tribe is one of the main tribes in South Africa. There are many Xhosa clans, each with their styles of drums and dialects. The Xhosa music is characteristically expressive and communicative, including the rhythmic expression of words and sounds as well as physical movement employed when cheering, dancing, or playing a musical instrument. Traditional Xhosa music has been adapted in a contemporary way and made famous throughout the world by Miriam Makeba. Born in Johannesburg, her mother was a Swazi ethnic Sangoma and her father, a Xhosa. He began singing on a professional level in the fifties, with the Manhattan Brothers group, and then founded his band, The Skylarks, which combined jazz and traditional South African music. Needs an injection of joy? [Listen to the Pata Pata song](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=JBJVVhn7iuo). The song was a burst of gloriously defiant revelry even in times of hardship and oppression.\n\n#### CANADA: The perfect blend of past and present\n\n![](image\u002F167)\n\nIn Canada, the music group [A Tribe Called Red](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=cj3U0z64_m4) blends instrumental hip hop, reggae, moombahton and dubstep-influenced dance music with elements of First Nations music, particularly vocal chanting and drumming. They started to experiment with electronic music, and they also include poetry, storytelling, and collaborations with other Indigenous peoples, being activists for Indigenous rights.\n\n#### MONGOLIA: Pump it up with throat singing and dream of adventures\n\n![](image\u002F165)\n\nMongolian throat singing tradition can be traced back to many centuries ago; however, in current Mongolia, a very well-known group has incorporated this particular singing technique to their metal repertoire. [The Hu musical group](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=pD1gDSao1eA) decided to keep the Mongolian traditional culture while adapting to new influences and maintaining their music style, and today their music videos have millions of views from all over the world.\n\n#### PERU: New perspectives to honor cultural heritage\n\n![](image\u002F166)\n\nRenata Flores is a young musician from the Quechan Peruvian community. At only 19 years old, she decided to debut in the music industry singing in Quechua, the language of her ancestors. She combines Latin trap, rap, and reggaeton with her indigenous heritage. She sings about indigenous rights, female power, and she stands with her political views criticizing wars and corruption. She is considered a [pioneer in Quechua contemporary music.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=VQUrV_v7OK8)\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Touareg Music Credit:Tinariwen\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "Indigenous People: Pioneers in Nature Preservation",
                text: 'When we think about environmental protection and the preservation of oceans and forests, we often ignore the communities and populations that inhabit the land and the crucial role they play in supporting their conservation. This should come as no surprise, after all, it is their home.\n\nMost Indigenous communities believe the natural world is sacred and should be protected for generations to come. Their traditions and belief systems mean they look at nature with deep respect and great sense of belonging; perceiving themselves to be one of the main components of the natural world, not central to it.\n\nLandMark, the Global Platform of Indigenous and Communities Lands, declares that “50% (of the land represented on their website) or more is held by Indigenous Peoples and communities globally”. Their service to the world should not be underestimated: a third of global forests are primarily managed by indigenous peoples, local communities are fundamental in the global curbing of gas emissions and they protect around 80% of the world’s biodiversity, which is essential to global food security. Furthermore, lands managed by indigenous communities have considerably lower rates of deforestation and provide optimal protection of endangered species.\n\nIndigenous populations have such rich knowledge of the natural world that they are able to provide an important perspective — one that compliments modern approaches to nature conservation and sustainable development — when considering the impact of economic decisions on the environment.\n\nFor this reason, marginalized groups are beginning to gain recognition as key stewards of our environment given their capacity to coexist with the flora and fauna, with many of their agricultural and pastoral practices now used as examples of responsible development to teach countries across the globe how to preserve their natural resources and grow food. With environmental knowledge developed over centuries spent observing and understanding their natural habitat, it is safe to say that they can teach us invaluable techniques in respect of utilising natural resources and coexist with the environment in which we live.\n\n#### AMAZONIA: The “Lungs of the World”\n\n![](image\u002F175)\n\nBecause indigenous tribes adapted to survive in extreme climates, they have developed ways to grow crops in very harsh environments. An excellent example of sustainable forest management is traditional agroforestry practice in the Amazon forest, where the communities optimize land space in order to grow multiple crops and raise livestock simultaneously. If grown correctly, coffee, for instance, has proved to be a particularly sustainable plant since it is very easy for others to grow underneath it, allowing indigenous communities to exploit the space effectively. Meanwhile, in herding lands across Latin America, pastoral communities practice sustainable cattle grazing and cropping that preserves the rangeland’s overall biodiversity, and in the highlands, indigenous communities have developed systems to preserve soil, reduce erosion, conserve water and minimize the risk of natural disasters.\n\n#### SAVANNA: Sustainability, Poaching and Scarce Resources\n\n![](image\u002F203)\n\nThe Ba’Aka pygmies of Central Africa are a good example of how indigenous peoples are involved in environmental sustainability, specifically the crucial role they play in the management of flora and fauna in nature reserves: something recognised in few African countries. Hunting only in one area at the time so that animals can slowly repopulate, parts of the local rivers, streams and forests are considered sacred, meaning fishing or hunting in these areas are banned entirely thus allowing fish and small game to breed. They often grow fruit trees on their farms and around the village, reducing their impact on the land and damage caused to wild plants.\n\nWorking with the government, they also collaborated to restrict gun usage and limit hunting during rainy seasons, however by far their most important role today is as official guardians of the wildlife. Establishing youth groups that control poaching — groups that regularly monitor the reserves and the report situations to either local organizations or the village’s chief — their activism is serving to dramatically increase the control of illegal hunting in the area.\n\n![](image\u002F159)\n\nBy no means the only such case in Africa, in Northern Kenya the Lakipiak Maasain tribe — meaning "People of Wildlife" — are custodians of the only community-owned rhino sanctuary in the country. Controlling the presence of wild animals, they enable local tribes to continue hunting for food by strategically reducing bush cutting that guarantees more fodder for wildlife without disrupting the fragile local ecosystem.\n\n#### SIBERIA: Harsh Climates and Nature Conservation\n\n![](image\u002F181)\n\nOn the other side of the world, in Siberia, the Chukchi people have herded reindeer for hundreds of years: over time, developing numerous mechanisms for controlling the herd size based on moss resources. And they’ll breed small herds with large ones in order to reduce the numbers in the latter so they don’t grow beyond their resources.\n\n#### OCEANIA: Tradition and Modern Times\n\nAnother great example of traditional sustainable practices can be found in the Māori communities of New Zealand. If we take the Māori word ‘kaitiakitanga’, which means protecting nature to respect descendants and future generations, we begin to understand the way in which the Maori people consider humans to be equals with nature; both belonging to the same kin. The Māori communities make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s farming economy and legally own many lands, giving them the power to protect and preserve them. Several national projects have included the application of traditional environmental knowledge, and more recently, the New Zealand’s central government has expressed an interest in preserving ecosystems through environmental programmes. In addition, Māori health and wildlife management are both now fully integrated into the sustainable management of natural resources and monitoring of the environment.\n\n#### THE ABORIGINAL: Indigenous Peoples and Bush Fires\n\n![](image\u002F207)\n\nAustralia’s Aboriginal people use “cool burns” to eliminate select plants and trees in order to keep balance in the landscape and allow new ones to grow. This means that when a natural fire occurs due to the exceedingly high temperatures or a lightning strike, the destruction can be easily controlled. After Australia was colonized and fire management practices in Australia shifted to adopt non-indigenous methodologies, there was a noticeable increase in both the size and frequency of such fires.\n\n#### BALI: Millennial Rice Terraces\n\n![](image\u002F223)\n\nBuilt over thousands of years by the locals, the sophisticated irrigation system — or “subak” of Bali’s rice terraces acts as a natural drainage basin, with an underground canal system bringing mineral dense water from the volcanic soil to naturally fertilize the rice. For this reason, the terraces remain one of the most biodiverse and productive rice-growing soils in the world.\n\nSadly many communal lands are not legally recognized by national governments, who are instead investing in the construction of new roads or involved in other unsustainable forestry businesses in their territories. Oil corporations and mining companies often offer money to indigenous families knowing that they don’t have the financial means to provide for their children, and today, indigenous communities are fighting illegal invasion, destructive exploitation, logging and mining in their forests, and the building of mega dams across their rivers. After decades of discrimination and neglect, the official role of indigenous peoples remains as guardians of nature and crucial protagonists in the efforts to mitigate climate change, however unfortunately, they are also becoming targets, with some excluded from their ancestral lands and forced to become ‘conservation refugees’ in other countries. Fortunately, the rights of indigenous people are now protected in documents such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, and even reflected in government policies and the conservation programmes of some organisations, which are in turn investing more and more in the protection of indigenous culture.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo: Rice terraces Bali iStock.com\u002FSAKDAWUT14\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                title: "À la Carte in The Amazon",
                text: "For centuries, South America’s Amazon rainforest has provided a rich hunting ground for indigenous tribes, who don’t cultivate large quantities of fruits and vegetables. Instead, they rely on foraging and gathering, sometimes with small farm plots to supplement their intake of these foodstuffs, especially as over time they have become less nomadic.\n\nAs the Amazon is by far the largest jungle, it is also home to the widest variety of wild foods, which has often been left to grow untouched for generations. The one difficulty its occupants face are the scarcity of farmland, as clearings large enough to plant anything are usually rare, and their traditional utensils would make chopping down a load of ancient trees a huge amount of work. The tribes therefore typically live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle; one that has served them well for hundreds, if not thousands of years.\n\nGiven their reliance on sourcing wild foods from the abundance of the rainforest, the tribes’ diets may vary depending on the exact location, however there are a few plants and animals that remain constant in the Amazon, and as such are the most commonly consumed.\n\nFor example, if you were to look at an à la carte menu for Amazonian tribespeople, you would typically expect to see the following:\n\n#### Fruits &amp; Vegetables\n\nNotorious for their antioxidant health benefits, acai berries are available in abundance to the rainforest's hunter-gatherers. Marketed (with much hype) around the world as a “superfood”, for the Amazon dwellers, the acai berry is merely there, available to pick whenever they’re feeling peckish.\n\n![](image\u002F160)\n\nThe maracuja, better known as the passion fruit (‘Passiflora incarnata’), is another traditional fruit widely eaten by the rainforest inhabitants, where it grows on vines. Reaping many nutritional, health, and medicinal benefits from the fruit, the indigenous people use the leaves to make drinks that calm the nerves as well as a popular maracuja tea.\n\nAnother wild food in plentiful supply throughout the rainforest but yet to gain the global appeal of the acai berry is the Aguaje: a bright yellow fruit covered in dark maroon scales that tastes similar to a carrot and is often eaten raw.\n\nChayote, a vegetable cultivated by the Aztecs and Mayans in Central America is believed to be indigenous to the Amazon, likely because it grows well in the higher altitudes of mountainous rainforest regions.\n\nAnother favourite of the tribes, hot peppers are indigenous to the lowland rainforests of Central and South America, where they were domesticated by Native American shamans for their spice, which was used for both medicinal and spiritual purposes. There are approximately 25 wild hot pepper species that originated in the Amazon rainforest.\n\n#### Grains\n\n![](image\u002F227)\n\nMaize is pretty much the only grain that consistently grows wild in the Amazon. Whilst there are other small seeds eaten by the tribes, maize is the primary source for tribes throughout most of the region.\n\n#### Meat &amp; Fish\n\n![](image\u002F226)\n\nThe Amazon is home to wild pigs, monkeys, orangutans, tapirs, jaguars, sloths, armadillos, ocelot, snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, alligators and ‘caimen’—another member of the alligator family—otters and various types of birds.\n\nDolphin, stingray, catfish, piranha, eel, freshwater crab, mussels and several other small species of freshwater fish are all found in the rainforest’s rivers and commonly consumed as part of the hunter-gatherer diet.\n\n#### Flavorings &amp; other wild foods\n\n![](image\u002F162)\n\nBlack peppercorns, mustard, vanilla, cinnamon, and, of course, Brazil nuts.\n\nSo whether you’re visiting the Huaorani Ecolodge in Ecuador or the Tambopata Research Center in Peru, you’ll find yourself chowing down on a variety of fruits and vegetables, and while some of them will be completely new, others will be surprisingly familiar.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003EPhoto credit: Native Brazilian child eating food iStock.com\u002Ffilipefrazao\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "Discover the Traditions of the Omo Valley’s Ethiopian Tribes",
                text: 'Declared a World Heritage Site in 1980, the Omo Valley is one of the most important sets of paleontological sites in Africa. Known as ‘the cradle of humanity’, it was multiple discoveries made in this area that helped confirm the evolution of primates from swinging through the trees to walking upright.\n\nThe Omo Valley also has immense cultural wealth as it has been inhabited by a large number of indigenous tribes fighting for their survival for thousands of years.\n\nHere we look at some of the most original traditions that make these tribes stand out as particularly unique.\n\n#### Nyangatom Tribes: Storytelling and Singing\n\n![](image\u002F232)\n\nThe Nyangatom are widely recognized to be the tribe with the best singers and storytellers, and it is common for the younger members to sing songs about cows and bulls during celebrations, traditional ceremonies, and even during fights with neighbouring tribes. The stories and songs of the Nyangatom often become famous throughout the region and are repeated throughout the entire Omo Valley.\n\n#### Mursi Tribes: Spectacular Body Decoration\n\n![](image\u002F230)\n\nThe Mursi is one of the most aesthetically captivating Ethiopian tribes. When they turn 20 their wives wear clay or wooden plates embedded in their lips and ears: the bigger the plate, the greater the likelihood that they will marry as these accessories are a form of seduction. Contrary to popular belief, Mursi women do not wear the plates all the time, as they make it uncomfortable for them to eat and talk. However they always wear wooden earrings, many bracelets, stylish haircut, scarification and colourful fabrics that make them look incredibly striking.\n\nMen paint their bodies with natural pigments extracted from rocks, minerals and cow dung, which protects the skin from sun and thorns in addition it serves as both a dramatic way to attract their future wives and to command respect from their opponents in festive battles as a demonstration of their courage and aggressive warrior spirit. Scarification — permanent modifications made by scratching, etching, burning, branding or cutting designs into the skin — across the entire body are also seen as hallmarks of strength.\n\n#### Hamer Tribes: Cattle Jumping Ceremony\n\n![](image\u002F235)\n\nThe most important Hamer youth rite is the "Ukuli Bula", which is a necessary ritual to demonstrate that a man has entered adulthood and is capable of owning cattle, raising a family, and becoming a fully-fledged member of the tribe. When his parents decide that the time to perform the ceremony has arrived, the young man invites all the members of his tribe — along with those from nearby villages — to witness the event. The families of the boys bring what is deemed a fair number of cows and the women dance in their best clothes, creating a rhythmic beat with jingle bells tied below their knees. The cows are then lined up in a row, and the applicant takes a run-up and jumps over the cows’ spines until he reaches the other side. They jump back and forth until the "Mazas" (his age mates who had previously jumped) stop him. If he manages to perform these jumps successfully, he is seen to have passed the test and is ready to assume the role of adult with all the tribal responsibilities that entails.\n\n#### Benna Tribe: Calabash Caps\n\n![](image\u002F231)\n\nThe Benna woman\'s cover their braided hair with beautifully decorated calabash caps for multi protection purposes. The Benna men are famous for stylish hair ornamenting, like beaded headbands. These intricate creations are complicated to put on, so the Benna usually take these with them wherever they go, sleeping with their heads on wooden headrests to protect them.\n\n#### Dassenech Tribe: Ritual Cattle Sacrifice\n\n![](image\u002F233)\n\nThe “Dimi” is the most important ritual in the life of a Dassenech man and involves the sacrificing of large numbers of cattle such as cows and goats to bless the fertility and future of a young marriage. Members of the tribe dress in their most elaborate finery: ostrich feathers, oxtails, and leopard skins. Songs and dances are an important part of these ceremonies, as are the blessings of the village leaders to the girl to be wed. This rite is usually performed dry season when a lack of pastures means the animals are not as valuable as livestock.\n\n#### Karo Tribe: Chalk Paint Body Decoration\n\n![](image\u002F228)\n\nThe Karo decorate their bodies with chalk paint, often imitating animal print or the spotted plumage of some birds, especially on the face and torso. When a tribe member has killed an enemy or dangerous animal, scarifications are also made on their chests to boast of their bravery. Women cover their bodies with cowhides and use metallic accessories. For Karo women, ornamenting the body and face is considered a way to highlight their attractiveness and indicate their social status.\n\n#### Konso Tribe: Warrior Sculptures\n\n![](image\u002F234)\n\nIn the towns of the Konso (which are typically more developed than those of their neighboring tribes due to the level of construction), it is common to find sets of wood carvings in the central square. These sculptures, called "Wakas", honor dead warriors in one of the most famous and ancient traditions of the Konso people. The larger central figure is dedicated to the warrior themselves, while smaller ones, located either side, represent their families and enemies.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM** *in collaboration with* **EMANI CHENEKE** *\u002F Ethiopia*\n\n*Plan your trip to visit the peoples of the Omo Valley in our Tribes section.*\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo: Karo warrior \u002F Emani Cheneke\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                title: "Incredible Indigenous Homes: Adapting Architecture to the Environment",
                text: 'Nomadic people use traditional, locally-sourced materials to construct temporary or permanent dwellings, shelters adapted to suit both the climate and specific needs of the tribe. Houses are built using materials available in the area and are considered extraordinary modern-day examples of ancient vernacular architecture.\n\nOne example of such construction is the versatile Mongolian ‘ger’ (yurt), which remains cool in the heat of continental summers and holds warmth in the sub-zero temperatures of winter, with a central ventilation hole (that can be closed if needed) and a chimney for the stove.\n\n**But what exactly do we mean by ‘vernacular architecture’?**\n\nThe term ‘vernacular’ means "domestic, native, indigenous" and originates from the Verna for "home-born slave". It refers to spontaneous architecture characterized by the use of local materials and traditional knowledge that makes it adaptable to climatic needs by taking advantage of the environmental resources available.\n\nSome nomadic shelters have been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites due to the vast heritage their architecture preserves, while others have inspired contemporary artists to create new works.\n\n**Let’s discover a few examples…**\n\n#### Dogon Villages\n\n![](image\u002F237)\n\nThe cliff of Bandiagara has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site for its outstanding cultural significance and natural beauty. Part of Dogon Country, the cliff conceals unique villages rich in tradition, not least vernacular architecture. But why have these particular constructions been regulated? Historically, the cliff provided protection from enemies and severe weather conditions, while living on the cliff freed the land of the plains for agriculture, and as such, enforced protection of the cliff has guaranteed the preservation of centuries of ancient Dogon culture.\n\n#### Korowai Tree Houses\n\n![](image\u002F243)\n\nThe incredible architecture of the Korowai tree houses, suspended well above flood-water levels, is another example of defensive fortification. Built to prevent rival clans from capturing members of the tribe for slavery or cannibalism, they also protect its inhabitants from biting insects and even—it is believed—evil spirits. All of the materials used to construct the tree houses come from the jungle, with branches making the frame and bark of the sago palm used for both floorboards and walls. The roof is woven from larger leaves and rattan bindings serve to fasten everything together securely. The Korowai are known to build their houses in a matter of only one or two days, yet they typically last between three and five years, with new houses constructed in the same clearing—or moved to another, depending on the available resources of food and materials in the area at the time—as required.\n\n#### Tiébélé Court Royale Houses\n\n![](image\u002F241)\n\nTiébélé is a village in the east part of Burkina Faso Country. Famed for its colorful windowless traditional houses, it is inhabited by the Kassena: the oldest ethnic group in Burkina who first settled in the region in the 15th Century. Tibelé Court Royale is a stunning example of a village constructed starting from natural local resources and used to express a stunning culture. Kassena people paint unique designs on the exterior walls of their houses, using colored mud and chalk, with this decoration done by the women, normally once a year. The bold colors of black, white and red are made using natural local materials: clay, kaolin, and coal. Tiébélé’s houses are built with defense in mind, be that against the climate or potential enemies, with protection ensured by their small doors and lack of windows.\n\n#### Bedouin Tents\n\n![](image\u002F239)\n\nOne of the most notable examples of architecture designed for the extreme climate it must defend its inhabitants against: easily disassemble and movable at short notice. A traditional Bedouin tent might be relocated daily, so is both light and quick to dismantle and re-erect. Tents are made out of local materials: goat or camel hair, and plant fibres. Typically black, they have almost mythical status in the field of nomadic architecture, with dozens of different variants. The tent’s loosely woven material allows the air to enter and circulate, meaning it is pleasant in the summer season, but that when it rains in the winter months the fibres swell making it waterproof. Traditionally, one side of the tent is the ‘makhad’, a place to meet and receive guests, while the other is where the family lives.\n\n#### Ndebele Homeland Houses\n\n![](image\u002F236)\n\nNdebele tribes have adopted a cone-on-cylinder build consisting of mud walls and a thatched roof since the late 1800s, however in current rural settlement patterns these single, nuclear family houses are built on square stands rather than the traditional cylindrical shape, and a wide range of modern building materials and designs have been introduced. The most dramatic feature of Ndebele homes is their colorful wall decorations, and the Ndebele’s unique designs have become a source of inspiration for designers all over the world: French footwear designer Christian Louboutin designed a pair of shoes using the culture’s traditional motifs, and Esther Mahlangu, an internationally recognized Ndebele artist, has had her work commissioned for commercial use by BMV and South African Airways.\n\n#### Toraja Houses\n\n![](image\u002F242)\n\nTorajan traditional ancestral houses in South Sulawesi (Indonesia) are called ‘Tongkonan’. They are constructed on wooden piles, topped with layered split bamboo roofs shaped in a curved, sweeping arc, and detailed wood carvings in red, black or yellow adorn the exterior walls. The word ‘tongkonan’ means "to sit”, in their language, as the house is central to the tribe’s social activities and represents a link to a family’s ancestors. With distinguishing boat-shaped, oversized saddleback roofs, the construction of tongkonan is laborious work, and the houses are usually built with the help of all family members or friends, making it a special social activity. In the original Toraja society only nobles had the right to build tongkonan, while commoners lived in smaller, less ornate homes known as ‘banua’.\n\n#### Tataouine Storey Buildings\n\n![](image\u002F238)\n\nAn example of vernacular architecture designed to ensure the protection and conservation of food supplies, Tataouine multi-storey vaulted buildings are made from adobe: raw, earthen bricks made with a mix of clay, sand and binding material. The buildings are located in the southern part of Tunisia. The ‘ksar’—meaning “historical district”—consists of two courtyards, each with a perimeter of multi-storey vaulted adobe cellars called ‘ghorfa’. The cellars were originally used to store grains, olive oil and animal fat, with the food kept cool and dry behind the thick brick walls and palm wood doors: quite a miracle considering temperatures easily reached 40°C. The entire Tataouine complex was a fortified settlement, with only one entrance shaped to protect goods and food from enemies and theft.\n\n#### Konso Village Ethiopia\n\n![](image\u002F244)\n\nKonso, a small town in Southern Ethiopia, has a population that lives primarily from cultivating cotton and agriculture in general. Named after the Konso people, the town—and its 5,500ha of surrounding cultural landscape—was declared a World Heritage Site in 2011 due to its historical terraced agriculture and traditional villages. Important features of the site are the unique designs of the houses themselves, as well as their organization: 32 individual dwellings set behind 1 to 6 rows of defensive stone walls and fossil beds. The communities build traditional reservoirs to supply the villages with water during the dry season, and the terraces are built behind stone walls up to 5m in height to prevent soil erosion and maximize the collection of rainwater for use in such instances, to both ensure and enhance agricultural production.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Dogon Village iStock.com\u002Ftrevkitt\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\nReferences\n\n- [Field Study of the World](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.fieldstudyoftheworld.com\u002Fvernacular-architecture-of-dogon-country-and-its-development\u002F)\n- [Cliff of Bandiagara - Unesco](https:\u002F\u002Fwhc.unesco.org\u002Fen\u002Flist\u002F516)\n- [Unesco Activities](https:\u002F\u002Fwhc.unesco.org\u002Fen\u002Factivities\u002F496\u002F)\n- [Konso Culture - Unesco](https:\u002F\u002Fwhc.unesco.org\u002Fen\u002Flist\u002F1333)\n- [Cour royale de Tiébélé - Unesco](https:\u002F\u002Fwhc.unesco.org\u002Fen\u002Ftentativelists\u002F5653)',

                text: "They manage 80% of the Earth’s biodiversity, yet they only occupy 22% of planet’s surface. They represent fewer than 5% of the global population, but amount to 15% of people living in poverty.\n\nWhich social group are subject to these statistical imbalances? We are talking about the world’s indigenous communities.\n\nAlthough international organizations generally avoid attributing a universal definition to the world's indigenous communities, the United Nations has identified two common features that encompass them: specific legal rights based on historic links with a certain territory, and; cultural, linguistic and historical differences to other peoples who dominate them politically.\n\nThe United Nations approved the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, establishing a universal framework of minimum standards for the dignity, well-being and rights of indigenous peoples worldwide. This declaration promulgates the suffering of indigenous peoples, caused by “historic injustices… preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests”.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ESource: Sustainability for all &amp; FAO\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "COVID-19, An Unprecedented Global Alert",
                text: "After several weeks of global health alerts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus and its disease, COVID-19, a pandemic. This means that it is spreading throughout the planet and that no country can be considered safe.\n\nThe definition of a pandemic does not speak of its severity or lethality, but implies that a disease is transmitted locally in multiple countries throughout the world, and not only through travelers who come from one or two original sources. Until now, coronavirus was an epidemic, implying a geographically localized outbreak in East Asia. But the local expansion in Europe and the US, through contagions with no relation to China or South Korea, have pushed it to the next level.\n\nThe declaration of a pandemic forces the governments of affected countries to move to the mitigation phase as soon as possible, since it is not enough just to control people who have visited risk areas. Now, everyone is at risk because the virus multiplies in an uncontrolled way.\n\nAccording to WHO reports, The COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However, current evidence suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms. These are elderly people; and those with underlying medical conditions. WHO emphasizes that all must protect themselves from COVID-19 in order to protect others.\n\nThe disease is wreaking havoc on the world economy and most sectors are being affected in an unprecedented way. The latest UNWTO data reflects that the tourism sector is currently one of the most affected by the outbreak of the disease. Travel restrictions and flight cancellations have significantly decreased the supply of travel services as demand continues to drop.\n\n#### IT'S TIME TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST\n\n![](image\u002F82)\n\nThe most important thing is to keep people safe. The coronavirus contagion rate is clear: it spreads way more quickly than SARS, regular flu and other viruses. In developed countries, the infection rate grows exponentially every day, even with advanced health systems and constant support from governments.\n\n#### BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WORLD’S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES?\n\nAccording to the UN, a large number of indigenous peoples—more than 300 million spread over some 5000 populations in 70 countries—live in a traditional semi-isolation that has prevented their immune system from getting used to fighting viruses. They suffer from poorer health, are more likely to experience disability and reduced quality of life and ultimately die younger than their non-indigenous counterparts. The gap in life expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous people is up to 20 years lower.\n\nFor this reason, and according to data from international organizations such as Survival International, indigenous communities are especially sensitive to new infections.\n\nReports from previous epidemics show how big a problem this can be. For example, while the H1N1 virus had an infection rate of 24 per 100,000 cases among the general population, it was considerably higher, reaching 130 per 100,000, among indigenous communities. This is in countries where there were trusted systems for accounting and processing data such as Canada. The data from underdeveloped countries is much more discouraging. In the case of COVID-19, we already know that there is a higher rate of contagion and therefore we can predict the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIndigenous peoples around the world are at greatest risk of contracting the disease, because most of them have poor immunity, suffer from other latent chronic diseases and have no access to medical infrastructure. Even a common cold can be deadly to them.\n\n#### WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IN A TRIBE ONCE A STRANGE PATHOGEN ARRIVES?\n\nAccording to another report by Survival International, when a strange pathogen reaches a small isolated group, even if only one person is infected, they will be cared for by their friends and family. It is likely that those people will then also be infected and the infection will spread rapidly to the whole tribe. Some will be more susceptible than others, but the elderly, young children, and the sick are in particular danger.\n\nOne of the consequences of an infection that affects an entire community is that very few people will get rid of it and, since it affects everyone at the same time, nobody will be able to hunt or collect food. Therefore, not only will they be sick but nobody will be able to take care of them or feed them. This will have serious consequences on the group's ability to continue surviving without help from abroad.\n\nSome indigenous communities are open to dealing with illness with either traditional or Western medicine, if they have access to it, which is not usually the case. Some others see illnesses as a punishment by the Gods and are more reluctant to seek treatment, spreading the disease in the community. However, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, states that indigenous communities have the right to promote, develop and maintain their distinctive customs, spirituality, traditions, procedures, and practices, and for that reason it is even more important to have extreme precautions to prevent the spreading of diseases among them.\n\n#### Afribadger COMMITMENT WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES\n\n![](image\u002F245)\n\nAt Afribadger, our focus is on the well-being of our global community of travelers, suppliers, staff, and, of course, the indigenous communities around the world. As a result of this, we have taken the decision to delay all bookings for the immediate future. It is our priority to support the tribes that we visit and at this time we do not believe that travel is in the best interest of the communities we work with. While the potential impact of this virus on indigenous communities is unknown, it is our responsibility to maintain the well-being of our global tribe and prevent further spread of the virus if possible.\n\nIsolation is being shown to be the best way to contain the virus. The governments of the most affected countries strongly recommend avoiding personal contact and taking extreme hygiene measures if there is no other choice but to leave home or travel.\n\nIt is time to be responsible, supportive and cautious. The mortality rate of this disease is 3.4% globally (this is a changing percentage that the WHO updates periodically), and we are all susceptible to carrying the virus and infecting more vulnerable people.\n\nIn addition, our commitment to indigenous communities goes further. Afribadger is already working on the creation of a foundation to help these communities. We will begin to study possible projects to mitigate the risk of these diseases and possible projects to support the effects it may have on indigenous peoples.\n\nIf you are travelling anywhere in the immediate future, we strongly recommend that you check with travel guidance and health advisories from your local government, and closely monitor the information from the World Health Organization.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo: Little African boy iStock.com\u002FRiccardo Lennart Niels Mayer\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "OPINION: COVID-19 Emergency Relief Must Reach Everyone, Including Minorities and Indigenous Peoples",
                text: "Time and time again, when emergencies occur, minorities and indigenous peoples are at risk of being excluded from life-saving humanitarian interventions. The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different and it is our moral obligation to ensure national responses leave no one behind.\n\nAid is supposed to be neutral, but we know this is not always the case. In a local situation where some are powerful and count, while others are powerless and don’t count, not everyone will receive aid according to their need.\n\nFor more than 50 years, we have documented the exclusion of minorities and indigenous peoples from responses to conflict and post-conflict situations (Roma in the Balkans, minority clan members in Somalia, and Muhamasheen in the current conflict in Yemen), to natural disasters (Dalits after the 2004 Tsunami). With today’s global emergency, we have a duty to address the issue of exclusion head-on, and ensure all responses to COVID-19 are inclusive of the world’s most vulnerable people.\n\n![](image\u002F123)\n\n**We therefore urge governments and healthcare providers to consider the following four points in their COVID-19 responses:**\n\n1. Lack of documentation should in no case be a barrier to the highest quality care. Minorities and indigenous people are less likely to carry an ID document (for example, Roma in Ukraine) and their citizenship may be contested or challenged (for example the Maragoli community in Uganda). If an ID card is needed to access health care, this can put minority and indigenous communities at a major disadvantage.\n2. All COVID-19 care should be provided free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay. Many minorities and indigenous communities are poorer than majority communities in the same country. We know that indigenous women access maternal health care less than other women and some of these women have told us that cost is a factor in this. This applies, for example to some women from the Chin community in Myanmar.\n3. Information about prevention and ways to seek help in case of symptoms should be made available in as many languages as possible. Translators without Borders has documented many instances of aid being provided in languages that the intended recipients do not speak well. Radio broadcasts in various languages, including minority languages, may be the best option.\n4. Nutrition and access to food should be a priority and should not depend on economic status. Minority communities and indigenous peoples are generally poorer, and their nutritional status may be worse. They are likely to have fewer resources to buy and store food, or to pay for medicines or treatment. They are unlikely to have reserves of either cash or food to sustain themselves whilst they may be unable to work. Batwa community members in Rwanda, for example, have told us they’re facing the prospect of living without an income since their traditional means of work (involving travel to other’s land) is no longer viable or available. Many minorities and indigenous people are more likely to migrate regularly, meaning they have no regular clinic and that government warnings to stay at home are not meaningful to them.\n\nParticularly in contexts where competition for health services or essential supplies becomes high, minorities who have lower social capital and are generally poorer and less represented in decision making processes are vulnerable to being pushed to the back of the queue, or otherwise face violence or discrimination when accessing aid. In a recent survey, those reporting on behalf of marginalised communities in Somalia saw almost double the level of violence against those accessing aid (25% of respondents) as those reporting on behalf of majority communities.\n\nGovernments and healthcare providers need to be aware of all the above factors and ensure that services reach all those who need them regardless of their location, language, ethnicity, religion or caste.\n\nThese problems can be overcome, but we must first admit that they exist. When those providing aid are aware of and sensitive to existing power relations in communities they serve, reaching everyone according to their need is perfectly possible.\n\nWe cannot let silent discrimination and outright racism enter our response to this crisis. Let’s ensure that our response is aware of religion, ethnicity, language and all other elements of the identity of those in need, in ways that ensure everyone is supported throughout this challenging time.\n\n**CLAIRE THOMAS**\n\n\u003Csup\u003EClaire is the Deputy Director of Minority Rights Group International.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n- [Minority Rights](https:\u002F\u002Fminorityrights.org\u002Fcoronavirus\u002F)\n- Article posted in: [Thomson Reuters Foundation](https:\u002F\u002Fnews.trust.org\u002Fitem\u002F20200324141217-not5s)\n\n\u003Csup\u003E\\*Any views expressed in the opinion pieces are those of the authors.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo: Doctor examining little Maasai iStock.com\u002Fhadynyah\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

It’s not something commonly taught in schools but in fact, we owe some of our most important modern-day inventions to their creativity and ancient wisdom.\n\nBecause indigenous people had to adapt to some of the most difficult environments on the planet with very limited resources, they developed exceptional skills that led them to design utensils, machinery, hunting and gathering systems, medicines and much more in order to enable their survival.\n\nExtremely advanced for their time, society today would be very different without these 8 indigenous inventions from tribes around the world:\n\n#### Kayaks\n\nThe Alaskan Inuit people were the first to build and use kayaks, at least 4,000 years ago.\n\nKayaks were small, narrow boats made of wood, with a sealed sealskin cabin to prevent the rower from sinking should the boat capsize.\n\nThe word kayak means "hunter\'s boat", as they were originally built for hunting and used to drag animals — seals, caribou, even whales — to shore.\n\nNowadays, kayaks are used all over the world for recreational activities and their design has not changed, although they are now made using different materials, such as plastic and carbon fiber.\n\n#### Syringes\n\nNative Americans made the first syringes to inject medicines in pre-Columbian times. These hypodermic needles were originally made from animal bladders attached to a sharp, hollow cylindrical bone — such as the leg of a prairie chicken, turkey, goose or other bird — which served as the tube.\n\nTheir invention was later attributed to Scotsman Alexander Wood in 1853, but our American ancestors had already developed them many centuries before.\n\nToday, the practice of medicine is unimaginable without the use of these vital utensils.\n\n#### Boomerang\n\n![](image\u002F118)\n\nThe boomerang was invented by Australian Aborigines and — contrary to popular belief — never used for hunting, but in rituals and celebrations.\n\nIt is said that the first tribe the English encountered in New South Wales in the 18th century were the Turuwals, who shouted "Boom-ma-rang!" as they launched and then caught a curved wooden object. This expression means "Come back cane!", although according to some historians the word comes from the aboriginal term "boomari", which means wind.\n\nNowadays, the boomerang is used to practice sports and play games, or as a decorative object.\n\n**Analgesics**\n\n![](image\u002F109)\n\nThe Amazonian and Andean indigenous peoples of South America pioneered the use of a variety of medicinal plants (leaves, roots, barks, flowers, seeds, resins, and oils) to manage ailments, and their combination to prepare infusions, syrups, plasters and powders that relieved pain and treated disease.\n\nAn example of this is ginger: a tubercle we currently use to flavor dishes, which indigenous healers prepared as a medicinal drink to relieve pain or reduce inflammation.\n\nTraditional medicine is part of the cultural legacy of indigenous peoples like the Tacana and Leco, who used quinine, cat\'s claw and evanta: all plants now recognised by the modern pharmaceutical industry.\n\n#### Chewing gum\n\nChewing gum can be traced back to Southeast Mexico and Northern Central America, where it originated as part of Mayan culture over two thousand years ago.\n\nThe Mayans made incisions in the bark of the Chicozapote — one of the most abundant trees in the area — so that the sap flowed into containers placed at the base of the trunk. After drying the tree\'s nectar, a chewy gum was obtained and used to clean the teeth and mouth or curb hunger in fasting rituals.\n\nToday, the habit of chewing gum is widespread throughout the world.\n\n#### Piercing and Tattoos\n\n![](image\u002F110)\n\nThe indigenous Colombians were pioneers in hair removal techniques, hair extensions, \'piercing\' and tattoos. From pre-Hispanic times to the present day, the tribes in Colombia have used the body as a canvas; an artistic expression of their culture.\n\nIn many different parts of the world, other cultures — such as the Maoris in New Zealand — also used tattooing as a statement of identity.\n\nIn some Borneo tribes, perforations were made in different parts of the body to implant piercings that marked the transition from adolescence to maturity.\n\nNowadays, piercings and tattoos are common across the world for aesthetic reasons, and as an affirmation of individual identity.\n\n**Baby bottles**\n\nAlthough some baby feeding utensils were already used by the ancient Egyptians and other cultures, the Native Americans invented the first baby bottle.\n\nUsing syringe-like technology, the Indians used bear intestines, which they washed, dried, and greased before attaching a feather as a form of nipple. The mothers then filled them with a mixture of nuts, meat, and water.\n\nToday the baby bottle is an essential item for families all over the world.\n\n**Sunglasses**\n\n![](image\u002F107)\n\nThe very first piece of equipment attached to the eyes in order to protect them from the sun’s rays can also be attributed to the creativity of the Inuit people, who manage to survive one of the most extreme climates on the planet.\n\nMade of wood, bone, or ivory, they were originally fastened with strips of whale skin and designed to avoid snow blindness: a frequent and serious problem for the Inuit people that occurred when the snow’s strong reflective power directed damaging ultraviolet rays into the eyes.\n\nToday, all around the world, who doesn\'t wear sunglasses?\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo: (CC BY 2.0) Inuit kayaker\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                title: "Alternative Medicine: The Knowledge of Indigenous Peoples",
                text: 'When we talk about health and medicine, we are often referring to a general, westernized concept of the term.\n\nBut what does it mean for indigenous peoples? What is their approach to medicine and healthcare? Here, we look at some of their traditional knowledge and discover the range of long-established practices still being used across Africa, America, Canada and Australia.\n\nIt is common for indigenous tribes to use either traditional or western medicine, but they sometimes employ a combination of the two. According to the United Nations report State of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, both ‘western’ and ‘traditional’ methods refer to systems of medical practices that use the approach of treating illness through remedies that produce effects that counter or oppose its symptoms.\n\nThe Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) has defined traditional medicine and indigenous health systems as including myths, procedures and rituals that connect health with the treatment of physical and mental illness. Traditional medicine is identified as the sum of both knowledge and practices that rely on past experiences anecdotally passed down from generation to generation, and as such we consider this vast, intangible heritage something that must be protected.\n\nAssuming these concepts and definitions, the United Nations’ Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Article 24, states that:\n\n- Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individuals also have the right to access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services.\n\nCurious to know more about the health practices, traditional methods and medicinal herbs of the indigenous peoples? Let’s discover them together!\n\n#### Medicine in Africa\n\n![](image\u002F114)\n\nThe use of medicinal plants is integral to the entire African traditional healthcare system, not just indigenous peoples, and in many parts of rural Africa, the traditional healers prescribing them are actually the most affordable health resource available.\n\nThe full knowledge of plant species used and related methods of preparation — the unique processes that transform them into medication — still resides with traditional healers, and remains secret and exclusive because it cannot be shared with anyone other than family members and relatives.\n\nThe methods used to prepare herbal medicines from fresh and dry plants, may vary according to tribe, place and culture, but the preparations themselves generally include:\n\n● **Extractions:** Plants are prepared with solvent on a weight by volume basis.\n\n● **Infusions:** Plants are prepared by macerating the crude drug for a short period of time (in either hot or cold water, with honey sometimes added to prevent spoilage).\n\n● **Tinctures**: Alcoholic ‘infusions’ that can be diluted before administration.\n\n● **Decoctions**: Woody parts of the plant are boiled for an established period and then filtered.\n\n● **Ashins:** Dried parts of the plant are incinerated to ash, sieved and added to water or food.\n\n● **Miscellaneous:** External applications in liquid containing the active plant substances, used on the skin.\n\nMedical herbs are commonly administered orally, topically, rectally or nasally, although alternative methods include smoking a cigar containing herbs or passive inhalation of the drug.\n\nHealthcare practices and practitioners have different names depending on the ethnic group. For example, in Nigeria, what is called “Babalawos” by the Yorubas, is called “Bibia” by the Igbos, and “Boka” by the Northerners or Hausas.\n\nA tribe closely linked to the forest and its plants is the Batwa of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Batwa still deeply value the forest: the environment is their major heritage as it has always guaranteed their most important resources. Before access was denied, these forests provided food, shelters and refuge. The forest herbs always provided the Batwa with their medicines too. Studies suggest that the belief in traditional medicine is still as strong amongst the newer generations of the tribe and that the youngest still have doubts about the effectiveness of modern medicine.\n\n#### Medicine in South America\n\n![](image\u002F112)\n\nFor indigenous peoples in South America, an equilibrium and harmony with nature is considered the basis for good health and illness occurs when its balance is altered.\n\nWith origins in ancient Aztec and Incan cultures, herbal and holistic remedies remain widespread amongst indigenous peoples, with many of the herbs used by the Aztecs years ago still the main ingredient in medicines today.\n\n● **Wormwood:** The use of wormwood in medical preparations is popular with indigenous peoples today. The Central American species of wormwood (‘Artemisia Mexicana’) was used by the Aztecs both as a ritual herb and as a medication — referred to by the tribes as “Iztauhyatl” — in the treatment of digestive problems such as diarrhea, stomach ache, colic and rheumatism. ‘Artemisia Mexicana’ has also been found to treat malaria and as topical remedy. Prepared with a solution of alcohol, the plant could be mixed with other compounds depending on the symptoms to be treated, and often an oil to make a ‘suspension’ (a liquid in which small pieces of the drug are not dissolved in the solution) of the medication.\n\n● **Marigold**: Used both to supplement other remedies and as a medication in its own right, in addition to treating many of the same digestive ailments as wormwood the essential oil of the marigold has antibiotic and antimicrobial properties. Marigold was traditionally used for more severe and persistent symptoms of digestive distress. The leaves could be brewed into a tea, crushed and burned as remedial incense, or used as an essential oil.\n\nThe Matsé—the indigenous peoples of Brazil and Perù—have recently created a 500-page encyclopedia on their use of traditional medicine. This is a unique case and represents huge action in their effort to conserve a millennia of culture and intangible heritage. Compiled by five shamans with the help of the Acaté conservation group, the encyclopedia describes each plant used in medicine as a remedy for a variety of diseases in detail. The Matsés have only printed the encyclopedia in their native language to ensure that researchers do not steal their vast medicinal knowledge, as has happened in the past. Instead, the volume is intended as a guide to train new and young shamans, and to preserve the knowledge of living shamans before they die.\n\n#### Medicine in Canada\n\nindigenous peoples in Canada have been using plants as medicine since ancient times, and more than 400 different species of plants with medicinal applications have been identified over the years. They refer to recognized ‘specialists’ for their use, and the specific methods of harvesting and preparing medicines are considered the intellectual property of these specialists and their families. Medicinal plants are treated with respect and reverence as their healing properties rely on specific spiritual preparation. Here are just some examples of well-known medicinal plants still widely used by indigenous peoples in Canada.\n\n● **‘Achillea millefolium’ (Yarrow):** Containing aromatic compounds including menthol and thujone, the leaves of this plant are used for colds and coughs, while the roots are used to treat sores, burns, abscesses, skin rashes and bronchitis. It can be used as a shampoo by soaking the leaves in water, and drinks made with the plant used to cure diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. Also used as a blood purifier, the indigenous peoples use Achillea to repel insects and treat insect bites.\n\n● **Artemisia species (Sagebrush, Wormwood, Sagewort):** There are more than 20 species of Artemisia in Canada traditionally used as medicines in the form of infusions or inhalants to treat colds, coughs, and respiratory ailments. They are also commonly used to ease skin irritations and cure infection, or as a solution for rheumatism and arthritis. Some species are even burned ceremonially and used as incense.\n\nThe Woods Cree of Saskatchewan are part of the Canadian Aboriginal. Their traditional use of medicinal herbs included the consumption of dried roots as winter foods, with fresh roots being sliced and fried to eat. Flower buds can be cooked and eaten too, but different types are traditionally combined as remedies for headaches, aching limbs or swelling, or used as poultices for treating wounds. Rhizomes (the stems of the flowers which grow underground) are cut into rounds and dried, and then either put into tea as a remedy for arthritis or used to treat an area of the body that has been specifically affected. Once ground into a poultice, fresh roots can be applied to wounds, and decoctions are given to women recovering from childbirth.\n\n#### Medicine in Australia\n\nWhilst the use traditional medicine of indigenous peoples in Canada is quite well know, in the Australian bush it is less so. Most Aboriginal medical treatments were derived from food. Aboriginal people use plants in a variety of ways: some of them are crushed, heated and applied to skin, and others boiled, inhaled or drunk. Many of the plants used by Aboriginal people contain antibacterial and anti-inflammatory compounds known in western medicine. Some examples of this include:\n\n● **Tea tree oil:** The Bujjalung, aborigines of the New South Wales coast, commonly use tea tree leaves and apply them on wounds as a paste. The antiseptic potency of the tea tree oil was first demonstrated around the 1920s, and since then the oil has been used to treat almost anything—fungi, acne, wounds, etc—thanks to its incredible healing properties.\n\n● **Goat’s foot:** The Aboriginal from Northern Australia and parts of New South Wales first crushed and heated the leaves of the plant, then applied them directly to the skin as an effective method of pain relief. Heated on hot rocks and then applied as a poultice, the leaves were traditionally used to relieve stings and bites from insects, stingrays and snakes as well as a cure for skin irritation and infection.\n\n● **Emu bush:** The leaves of this plant have the same properties as established antibiotics, and are mostly used by the Aboriginal tribes of the Northern Territory to wash and disinfect sores and cuts. Today, some healing centers still offer traditional medicine practice (TMP) and bush medicines. For example, the Akeyulerre Healing Centre in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory offers stand-alone TMP, traditional healers and bush medicines.

                title: "Discover the Legendary Traditions of The H'mong People in Vietnam",
                text: "The Ta Phin commune is located in the mountainous district of Sapa, in the Lao Cai Province on the border of China. The commune center is set in a valley within walking distance of Sapa town, a popular tourist destination. The Hmong of Ta Phin grow rice and corn in their terraced fields and collect wood, orchids, and cardamom from the nearby forest. The higher land is a maze of narrow rice paddies alongside corn and vegetable fields, and the valley floors are dense with spectacular rice fields that supply the community with much of its resources.\n\n![](image\u002F99)\n\nTo supplement income, some women sell handcrafted goods to tourists in Sapa. They buy old skirts from Hmong women in other districts or embroidered remnants from Dao clothing, then re-dye and sew them into bags and hats. The Hmong women also sell shirts and other garments on the streets of Sapa for local business people to buy.\n\n![](image\u002F98)\n\nIt’s a common sight in the village to see the woman and girls sitting together, gossiping and laughing, heads down and focused on a piece of indigo-colored cloth. They make embroidery and brocade products which are then sold and traded amongst the villages and visitors. The locals are friendly and will readily invite tourists into their homes to show them how they live and what they own. On following them to their houses, you will discover how simply they live, so bear in mind that the purchase of a piece of merchandise would be a nice gesture; a tip, if you like, for the things they have shown you. In their homes, you will likely find the mothers and daughters cooking and sewing after long days of gossip and laughter in the rice paddies and cornfields. When not at home, they can be found far in the mountains of Sapa collecting wood.\n\n![](image\u002F100)\n\nSince 1998, Ta Phin has been known as the “brocade village”, a place where tourists can find eye-catching handmade brocades made by ethnic people. Ranging from bags, scarves, purses, and skirts to backpacks and coats, these products are entirely unique: distinctively patterned and brightly colored.\n\n#### Traditional skills and patterns of the Hmong in Taphin.\n\n**HEMP:** Women are responsible for growing and processing hemp, an important element in the production of Hmong clothing. Hemp is usually planted in March and harvested in July, after which it is dried and the bark — the hemp fiber — stripped from the stem, before being pounded, boiled, spun and coated with wax ready to be strung on the loom.\n\n![](image\u002F115)\n\n**INDIGO DYE:** All clothing is dyed with indigo, which is often planted in ‘kitchen gardens’ near to the houses and harvested in late spring, at which time it is made into a paste and the base cloth alternatively dipped and dried continuously for a period of 30 days.\n\n**SEWING:** Traditionally clothes are hand-sewn with white, pink or blue stitches along the hem. In a year, a woman will stitch a full set of clothes for each family member, and in the weeks before Tet she will be particularly busy with sewing, as the Hmong people wear their best clothes for the New Year celebrations.\n\n**SYMBOLS IN EMBROIDERY:** Most collars today incorporate a ‘cu’, or snail design, formed by a curling black chain stitch, whereas the design of sleeves and belts are more varied. Among the motifs are the ‘khau li’ — the instrument used for winding hemp fibers — and chicken feet, both important symbols in Hmong rituals. Plants and flowers are also represented.\n\n#### Clothing in customs and rituals.\n\n![](image\u002F97)\n\nDuring the festival of Tet, boys and girls dress in their best clothes as it is considered a time for courtship. A traditional game of ‘con’ allows them to observe each other as a corn cob with chicken feathers attached is thrown between a row of boys and a row of girls. A boy may give a girl his ‘shao khua’ (the Hmong name for the feathered cob) as a proposal of marriage, and if she doesn’t return it, formally accepts his offer. For her marriage, a woman may prepare many sets of clothes.\n\nMarriages sometimes happen by abduction, but mostly today, parents requiring a dowry often arrange them for their children. In this instance, a girl may receive cloth from the boys' family with which to prepare her clothing.\n\nA woman will wear a Hmong skirt made by women from the other districts when she gives birth. Not only is the skirt said to be more comfortable, but symbolic in that it represents the clothing of their mutual ancestors whom she will one day rejoin. It is for this reason that she will be buried in the skirt.\n\n#### Jewelry\n\nHmong women usually wear one or several large hoop earrings, known as ‘con de’, in each ear and one or more rings (‘po cu dang’) around their necks. Although once produced by the Hmong themselves, nowadays it is usually the people of Dao, or Giay ethnic groups in other villages, who produce these.\n\n**Duong Thi Minh Thu - Vietnam**\n\nPlan your trip checking out the H'mong Hill in our Tribes section.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Sunday market, Bac Ha, Vietnam iStock.com\u002FOscarEspinosa\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                text: "**UNWTO Recommendations on Sustainable Development of Indigenous Tourism (Part 1)**\n\nIndigenous peoples are characterized by some of the richest, most unique and diverse cultural expressions of humankind which have developed over thousands of years across our planet and are spiritually linked to indigenous traditional lands.\n\nThe United Nations World Tourism Organization published recommendations on Sustainable Development of Indigenous Tourism are referring first and foremost to tourism development within those indigenous communities that wish to open up to tourism or to improve the management of the existing indigenous tourism products and experiences within their communities.\n\nThese recommendations represent a clear pull factor for potential tourists who wish to experience indigenous natural and cultural heritage in physical, intellectual and emotional terms, and If managed responsibly and sustainably, indigenous tourism spurs cultural interaction and revival, bolsters employment, alleviates poverty, curbs rural flight migration, empowers local communities, especially women and youth, encourages tourism product diversification, allows people to retain their relationship with the land and nurtures a sense of pride.\n\nThroughout the centuries, indigenous people have faced different forms of discrimination, displacement from their ancestral territories, cultural assimilation and more recently a severe depletion of the natural resources they depend on. And In order for indigenous tourism to develop and prosper in a respectful and equitable manner, all stakeholders need to take into consideration the following key socioeconomic and human rights aspects directly related to indigenous communities:\n\nRespect cultural values and the cultural capital of indigenous groups, their physical, spiritual and cultural relationship with their traditional lands and customary laws, in order to be able to understand their expected benefits from tourism and the role they wish to play in it. Respect the management models that the indigenous communities wish to apply in tourism development.\n\n![](image\u002F87)\n\nEngage in a thorough, transparent and permanent consultation process on the planning, design and management of tourism projects, products and services. This process includes a dialogue between indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders (governments, destinations, tourism companies and others), as well as among indigenous community members whose consent to any tourism development is absolutely necessary.\n\nFrom an Empowerment point the UNWTO recommend that we help facilitate skills development and empowerment of indigenous communities through organizational structures and governance models, including self-governance, that enable efficient decision-making with regards to tourism.\n\nSupport equitable indigenous enterprises and sustainable business practices which not only ensure an enhanced economic benefit, but also contribute to protecting cultural and natural resources, intellectual property, fostering community development and improving individual livelihoods.\n\nEnsure that outcomes of tourism development are positive, and that adverse impacts on natural resources, cultural heritage and the way of life of the communities are timely identified and prevented or eliminated. And finally participate in the protection of natural and cultural assets of indigenous communities, as well as of their traditional lands.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ESource: World Tourism Organization (2019), \u003C\u002Fsup\u003E[\u003Csup\u003ERecommendations on Sustainable Development of Indigenous Tourism, UNWTO, Madrid.

                title: "Natural Disasters and Indigenous Peoples Traditional Knowledge",
                text: "**A Way to Protect Ecosystems and Promote Resilience.**\n\nThere are around 370 million indigenous people in the world and they make up less than five percent of the total human population; however, they manage over 25 percent of the world’s land surface and support about 80 percent of the global biodiversity, and they are considered the ultimate guardians of our world’s ecosystems. Their millennial knowledge is rooted in generations of hunting and agricultural practices, sustainable water and land use, leading to the conservation of biodiversity. Today, we consider their traditions, customs and practices fundamental for environmental protection and disaster risk management. Their unique skills and knowledge are no longer undervalued or ignored and many are included in numerous modern studies tackling natural disasters’ prevention.\n\nBecause they inhabit some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet, they have managed to develop exceptional approaches to cope with the extreme variations of weather. Their deep understanding of the surroundings is a practice embedded in their day-today lives and it is the reason to their resilience to climate-related natural hazards and disasters. However, rapid environmental alterations and major natural catastrophes usually happen in rural contexts where the repercussion are disastrous, and indigenous communities that cannot adapt rapidly enough to these changes are the ones to pay the price.\n\nNowadays, the relationship between indigenous knowledge and natural disasters is reflected in risk reduction and natural hazards’ prevention plans, disaster education and early warning systems planning. Numerous countries are including consultation and cooperation with indigenous communities in the elaboration of national plans. Nevertheless, many are afraid that all this knowledge could disappear forever.\n\n![](image\u002F86)\n\nModern disaster reduction technology used alone has proven that traditional knowledge is useful in local cultural and socio-economic frameworks. The general idea is that modern technology reduce communities’ ability to support themselves, and making them more and more dependent on external forces. All over the world, recent disasters confirmed the modern society’s failure to take care of the people and made communities feeling abandoned. Traditional principles adapted to modern society usually develop higher resilience, helping greatly communities worldwide. It is believed that ultimate disaster reduction actions should incorporate both modern technology and traditional knowledge.\n\nThe recognition and respect of the rights of indigenous peoples is addressed by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which is inviting the international community to further involve indigenous peoples in strategies for disaster risk reduction and sustainable development, and protect indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge, practices and traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation of biological diversity.\n\nMany are the examples of how indigenous knowledge prevented natural disasters and helped in the preparation of action plans to mitigate disasters, and governments are starting to see more and more the need to invest in this millennial expertise. For instance, the Australian government extended its support to the Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs), the Indigenous Rangers and it gave Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the possibility to continue their efforts to protect and conserve the biodiversity of their lands.\n\nIn Canada, the government is supporting the Indigenous Guardianship Program, in which indigenous communities have the right to manage their territories according to traditional laws and practices.\n\nIn Europe as well, the official recognition of the Havukkavaara forest in North Karelia in Finland opened the possibility to develop a community-based conservation program to help sustain traditional lifeways.\n\nIn Africa, Namibia specifically, the government recognized indigenous community-based natural resource management, resulting in the establishment of 82 conservancies, covering about 20 percent of the country’s surface area, and 32 community forests, saving animals from poaching and extinction .\n\nIn Japan, the use of indigenous wisdom and skills have reduced, but the country invested in the past years in traditional knowledge to help mitigate natural hazards. Flood disaster happen every year, especially in the delta area of the Gifu prefecture. Controlling the flood was impossible, yet, the communities developed very advanced assessments through knowledge, tradition and cooperation within the community. In early 19th century, a system of mutual assistance, cooperation and monitoring, helped the communities survive the floods. Bamboo planting and ring dykes construction, also served to protect the villages from the inundations. Still today, to reduce erosion, special structures are built on the riverbanks as well as elevated houses called “Mizuya” used by families in case of flooding.\n\nNot counting industrial accidents and pollution, every year Papua New Guinea experiences around two to three natural disasters and in the past 30 years alone, it has been hit by major catastrophes such as flooding, volcanic eruption, tsunami, landslide, and drought. The country is also one with the highest number of indigenous communities living traditionally. With a millennial knowledge of hazards’ prevention that has evolved over generations, today their expertise is employed by local organizations to mitigate hazards .\n\nThe latest disasters faced by India over the past decades, taught us how important is traditional wisdom when it comes to save lives. Traditional indigenous architecture play a major role in people safety during natural threats. Kashmir, in northern India, is very different from any other part of the country and climatic conditions vary from temperate to artic cold desert. Even though the area is a high seismic hazard zone, the communities living in this region had to adapt to the poor soil condition and learned how to build steady houses over the years. Their traditional architectural techniques is what saved many lives during the Kashmir Earthquake in 2005. Kashmir’s two types of constructions are the Taq and Dhajji-Dewari system, which are known today as earthquake safe construction practices. In the Taq system, timber pieces are places horizontally as runners inserted into the stonewalls, stopping the construction from cracking and keeping the building together during an earthquake. The Dhajji-Dewari system is very similar; however, the timbers are placed horizontally, vertically and crossed to keep the building even steadier. The Kashmir earthquake confirmed that traditional techniques for house construction in the region were safer than modern techniques employed at the time.\n\nIn 2006, heavy rain and flooding brought down the Barmer District of Rajasthan in western India. The region is mostly deserted and finding water is extremely difficult for local communities. Houses are still built with local materials and the construction technique are passed down from generation to generation. The huts are circular with a thatched roof and people learned to orient the house in such a way that allows the wind to ensure good ventilation since temperatures in this region reach about 50 C. It is understandable the general astonishment when the rains swamped completely the area in just few days; however the local communities showed incredible resilience and spirit of adaptation.\n\nThe assessments done in the region after the disaster underlined the importance of traditional wisdom in these situations, in which eco-friendly construction materials and expertise has been tested over generations and permitted to save lives during the floods.\n\nOn the 2nd of April 2007, at the Solomon Islands 52 people lost their lives due to an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.1 and its consequent tsunami. Studies demonstrated that the number would have been significantly higher if not for the appropriate reaction of the indigenous coastal populations.\n\nMost of the victims were immigrant Gilbertese and they did not react promptly to the withdrawing of the waters because they had no memory in their culture of such an event. On the other hand, the indigenous Solomon Islanders experienced numerous tsunamis in their lifetimes, and responded quickly after the earthquake.\n\nAnother similar case are the three islands Simeulue, Nias and Siberut in Sumatra, Indonesia. All three are very different culturally and socially, however they all experienced earthquakes and tsunamis, and their traditional knowledge played a critical role during the earthquake measuring 7.9 on the 12th of September 2007.\n\nTheir effective communication, traditional architecture and prompt response to the first wave of earthquake, diminished the fatalities tremendously during the disaster. Today, indigenous knowledge is included in effective tsunami and earthquakes response education .\n\nIf governments have a larger knowledge of ‘risk information’ compared to local communities, indigenous communities have richer local knowledge. The coexistence with modern alternative is crucial in the protection of local communities that can become more prone to disasters. This can be successful only if there is the active involvement of local communities and explanation of the benefits given by modern technology. Meanwhile governments and academia should recognize the importance of traditional practices and techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, indigenous communities have such an intimate connection with their natural surroundings, that their wide knowledge of nature and the environment is essential in increasing communities’ resilience of facing potential natural hazards’ impacts and environmental change. Indigenous people are those who save the world from apocalyptic migrations due to drought, heat waves, storms and floods, and we should all learn from them how to properly respect the Earth. Indigenous knowledge allowed communities to survive disasters over the centuries, however, because of modernization progresses indigenous practices are not always valued. When devastating disasters remind us of the force of Nature, more occurring in current times, indigenous practices are remembered once again as valued models of endurance.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003Ecover photo: Waving palm trees iStock.com\u002Fimagedepotpro\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "A Fantastic Itinerary For Hiking In Morocco",
                text: "Hiking in Morocco is an incredible experience, that goes well beyond the pure pleasure of admiring the landscape.\n\nThere's something truly special about trekking in Morocco, something that is hard to pin down and that you'd have to see to believe. Going deep into the Atlas Mountains - considered one of the hidden gems of Morocco- is a fantastic way not only to appreciate nature - picture snow capped peaks, creeks flowing through lush valleys, forests and much more - but also to get to know a very unique culture - that of the Amazigh communities, commonly referred to as Berbers (a term which, to be fair, they dislike as they find it insulting).\n\nYou can follow various trails to experience the beauty of the Atlas. One of the best around starts in Amizmiz, and takes the very few foreigners that venture there through the tiny villages scattered in this part of the country. Amizmiz is at a mere one hour drive from the busy Marrakech, but already feels like a world apart.\n\n![](image\u002F77)\n\nWith its 11000 inhabitants, Amizmiz is by and large the most populated town in this part of the Atlas. This should set the mood for what you may experience should you decide to venture in a land where foreign visitors are as rare as they are welcome, and were ancestral customs are still very much a thing.\n\nI recently had the chance to go hiking in Morocco Atlas Mountains, and it was a fantastic experience. In the course 5 days I managed to appreciate the beauty and solitude of the Atlas Mountains; I crossed a multitude of tiny villages; encountered the most friendly locals; enjoyed their culture and gorged on the delicious local food.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in experiencing the same, I have put together this post which contains a detailed itinerary, with what plenty of practical information about the distances and difficulties, about the sights and what you can expect, and finally where you can eat and sleep along the way.\n\nHowever, please beware that although this itinerary is very detailed and with plenty of useful information, I do not recommend hiking this multi-day trek independently and even less so to do it alone: the trail is often tricky to follow, and you'll be crossing villages where, should you not have some connection and not speak the local language, you'll have a hard time getting a place to stay and eat for the night.\n\nThe best option to go hiking in Morocco is then to go on an organized adventurous trip such as that organized by Afribadger, a new tour operator which strives to promote a new way of traveling by facilitating encounters between adventurous travelers and indigenous communities around the world.\n\n#### A 5 Days Itinerary For Hiking In Morocco\n\n![](image\u002F73)\n\n**Day 1 - from Amizmiz to Ait Irghit**\n\nThe first day on this itinerary for hiking in Morocco Atlas Mountain is spent walking from Amizmiz to Ait Irghit. You'll be leaving the small town to get more and more into the mountains, where you'll get increasingly immersed in nature and blissfully isolated.\n\nYou'll come across very few people during your walk - some shepherds, a few women with their children, and sheep and at times cows enjoying their pasture.\n\nThe walking time between Amizmiz and Amezi, where you will be having lunch, is about 2 and a half hours.\n\nOnce in Amezi, you'll have the first proper encounter with a local family, with the chance to learn a bit about the local customs and way of life - including the ritual of tea and washing hands before eating.\n\nYour lunch spot varies depending on the guide's choice, who picks a different family every time and usually makes it a point to help the family most in need. My group stopped at the very modest home of a widower and her beautiful children.\n\nAfter lunch you'll continue walking towards Ait Irghit, where you'll spend the night. It's a pleasant uphill walk and you'll arrive to your final destination in time for sunset. Once there, you will have the chance of visiting local families for tea and snacks and to get to know their way of life.\n\nOverall walking distance: 12 km\n\nOverall walking time: 6 and a half hours, including lunch break and several stops for photos.\n\nHighest point: 1724 meters above sea level.\n\nLunch break: the typical arrangement throughout this 5 day hike is such that meals are consumed at local homes and they usually consist of traditional food such as Tajine or Cous cous. On the first day, lunch will be eaten at a tiny Amazigh village called Amezi (Tidli).\n\nThe views throughout your first day of hiking in Morocco are beautiful. As you cross the green fields, you'll have views of the valley as well as the snow capped mountains, and on occasions you'll encounter men or women working alone in the fields.\n\nThe villages you'll cross are very modest - dirt streets, clay homes with little comforts - but give the overall landscape a nice touch.\n\nOnce you get to Ait Irghit, if the day is clear you'll have the chance to admire sunset.\n\nThis day is meant to ease you into the rest of the hike, so that you can adjust to the altitude. There won't be any major challenge. The trail is easy to follow and the terrain mostly good as you will usually be walking on a dirt road. The uphill walking will be more persistent after lunch, but it's nothing to worry about. You won't meet many people - on occasion, a few persons working in the field, a couple of kids on a donkey.\n\nMake sure to carry enough water for the day and some snacks to munch on before lunch, as on this day your lunch break will be rather late.\n\n![](image\u002F72)\n\n**Day 2 - from Ait Irghit to Infag.**\n\nThe second day of your hiking in Morocco itinerary will be spent walking from Ait Irghit to Infag, with a lunch break in Ait Ahmed.\n\nAfter breakfast, you'll have the chance to say goodbye to your host and their children, and then start walking out of the village and towards a thick, beautiful and pristine forest.\n\nThough the distance is slightly shorter and most of the day you'll be going downhill, the trail is very narrow in places and you'll have to pay close attention to where you put your feet, making the overall walking time slightly longer than the previous day.\n\nIf you didn't meet many people on your first day of hiking in Morocco, your second day will be even more peaceful. You'll only see people once you get close to your lunch spot, in the village of Ait Ahmed which you will be approaching from above, thus having beautiful panoramic views.\n\nThe walking time between Ait Irghit and Ait Ahmed, where you will be having lunch, is about 3 and a half hours. The village is larger than Amezi, where you have lunch on your first day, and the overall impression is that locals are more accustomed at seeing travelers.\n\nAfter lunch you'll continue walking towards Infag, a small village built along the side of the\n\nOverall walking distance: 11.3 km\n\nOverall walking time: 7 hours, including plenty of time for photos and lunch.\n\nHighest point: 1704 meters above sea level.\n\nLunch break: with a local family in Ait Ahmed.\n\nIn terms of views, this is probably the most interesting day of the itinerary. You will be walking through the forest, reaching some tiny waterfalls which are perfect for a photo break; and as you will approach the village where you'll have your lunch break from above, you'll be offered an incredible sight.\n\nYet, the best view is that of the snow capped mountains from the meadows where lonely shepherds take their cows to graze. It's an absolutely mighty and beautiful sight.\n\nAfter lunch, you'll continue walking mostly on a dirt road. The landscape will be a bit mode desolate and dry and approach various clay villages that look well hidden in the mountains.\n\nWhat to expect.\n\nThere are no major difficulties during your second day hiking in Morocco, other than the fact that the trail is at times quite narrow and not easy to follow - but this is hardly a concern since you'll be with an expert local guide at all times. You meet even less people than on the previous day - it is all about getting close to nature.\n\nCarry a power bank for your phone or make sure your camera is fully charged as there will be plenty of good photo opportunities.\n\n![](image\u002F74)\n\n**Day 3 - from Infag to Tizgga.**\n\nOn your third day you will be walking from Infag to Tizgga and your lunch break will be in Imi Ourmer.\n\nYou'll start walking soon after breakfast, making your way out of the village and towards the valley. Walking along the dirt road, you'll come to a river and you'll have to continue walking along that on a narrow but easy trail.\n\nAs you'll be crossing several villages, you'll get to meet more people and you'll be able to observe local life a bit more. In Imi Ourmer, your lunch spot, you'll have the chance of visiting a cooperative where local women dedicate their time to the art of traditional carpet weaving.\n\nThe walking time between Infag and Imi Ourmer is short around 2 and a half hours.\n\nAfter lunch, you'll cross a couple of villages until the trail becomes a steep uphill until your final destination, the village of Tizgga, the highest point you'll reach during your time hiking in Morocco. The village has some pretty views over the mountains, but it is incredibly modest.\n\nOverall walking distance: 13.5 km\n\nOverall walking time: 7 hours, including lunch break and various stops.\n\nHighest point: 1953 meters above sea level.\n\nLunch break: at a local house in Imi Ourmer.\n\nThe views on your third day of hiking in Morocco are stunning. Soon after getting out of Infag, you'll reach a valley with a river flowing through it, and a viewpoint from where you can enjoy an encompassing view of your surroundings up until the snow capped mountains.\n\nThe village of Imi Ourmer, where you'll be having lunch, is set scenically along the river. Along the river there is a channel system used by local women to do laundry in the traditional way, and that is a nice thing to observe. This is one of the villages you're likely to enjoy the most, as the host family where you'll be having lunch has a nice, comfortable home (by local standards) and it is very welcoming.\n\nTizgga, where you will spending the night, is a village of very modest people who are however absolutely friendly. They will make it a point to show you the most intricate traditional clothes and even offer you to try them on to pose for photos.\n\nThough the first part of the day is fairly easy and the walk is pleasant, the walk up to Tizgga can be challenging as you'll be at a bit of an elevation, and the road you'll be walking along quite steep. Other than that, it is an absolutely pleasant walk.\n\nYou'll be tempted to buy a carpet from the women's cooperative there and then, but keep in mind that you'll be going through the same village on day 4 of this hiking itinerary, so you may want to spare yourself (or the mules) the effort of having to carry extra weight for at least one day.\n\n![](image\u002F76)\n\n**Day 4 - from Infag to Imintala.**\n\nOn your fourth day you will walk back down on the same trail you followed the day before, reaching the village of Imi Ourmer by lunch time.\n\nAfter lunch you will walk towards Imintala, one of the largest villages in the area, where you'll be hosted in a beautiful, very large traditional home that compared to the others where you'll be staying will feel significantly more comfortable - this is the only night where you'll be sleeping on a bad, though with your sleeping bag.\n\nThe village itself is more lively compared to the others and one of the most interesting one you'll be coming across when hiking in Morocco, and chances are you'll come across group of kids engaged in ball games who'll be glad to involve you, or other youngsters walking around for errands.\n\nOverall walking distance: 12.8 km\n\nOverall walking time: 6 hours, including lunch break.\n\nHighest point: 1939 meters above sea level.\n\nLunch break: at a local house in Imi Ourmer.\n\nFor the first half of the day, the sights will be the same of those of the previous afternoon. After lunch, as you'll be walking towards Imintala, you'll have views of the mountains and of the small villages scattered along the way. Unfortunately, there isn't much of a sunset view from Imintala or in its immediate surroundings, but it's still nice to get out a bit and admire the views.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThis is one of the easiest days of walking - for those who prefer going downhill. There are no major challenges along the way, and you will be happy to know that once in Imintala you will be able to enjoy a proper hammam.\n\n![](image\u002F71)\n\n**Day 5 - from Imintala to Amizmiz.**\n\nYour final day of hiking in Morocco will also be the longest one, but you won't encounter many challenges. The first part of the day will be spent walking towards Sidi Hssayn, where you will have lunch at a local home. After that, you'll make your way towards Amizmiz, the initial point of this hiking itinerary, where a car will be waiting for you to take you back to Marrakech.\n\nOverall walking distance: 20 km.\n\nOverall walking time: 7 hours, including lunch break.\n\nHighest point: 1486 meters above sea level.\n\nLunch break: at a local house in Sidi Hssayn.\n\nSimilar to the previous days, you will be looking at dry mountains where you will be able to spot several Amazigh villages.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThis is a long day - not so much in terms of challenges, but in terms of the distance you'll be walking, almost all of it on dirt road. Be prepared with snacks and plenty of water to keep your energy flowing.\n\n**General Information And Tips To Enjoy Hiking In Morocco**\n\nThe best tip I can give you if you plan to go hiking in Morocco is to get prepared for uncomfortable conditions. The hikes aren't strenuous per se, and although you won't be camping throughout this trail, you'll be sleeping at local homes (more about it below) which are as far as it can be from luxurious - in some cases, you won't even have a sink to wash your hands and brush your teeth before going to bed.\n\nThis is definitely not a trip for people who expect modern day comforts and who can't let a day go by without getting online.\n\nI recommend giving yourself enough time to follow the itinerary and add a few days in Marrakech at the end, so that you can enjoy a proper shower, rest in a good hotel and then move on to your next destination.\n\nYou may not be able to get a map of the trails but you can definitely download the tracks on Wikiloc, even more so as they work offline. Though - as I have stressed throughout this post - you shouldn't be walking this trail alone, having a trail with a map that you can follow will also give you an idea of your daily challenges.\n\nContinue reading for more tips on how to make the most of your time when hiking in Morocco.\n\nThe best starting point for hiking in Morocco Atlas Mountains is Marrakech, which is very well connected to other countries in Europe and beyond via flights with major and budget airlines. Marrakech Menara Airport is at just 10 km from the city center, but with traffic it may take you more than 30 minutes to reach your hotel.\n\nTaxis are easily available right outside the terminal, but in case you don't want to fiddle with money or worry about having to haggle a price, you can book a private transfer\n\nWhere to sleep in Marrakech.\n\nChances are you'll have to spend at least one night in Marrakech before you start your hiking trip. I actually recommend spending a few days afterwards as well, to explore the city - which has a lot to offer - and rest. The good news is that there are some excellent hotels in town, for all tastes and budgets.\n\nThe center of Marrakech is easy enough to explore. The nicest part is the Medina - though rumor has it that the Medina of Fez is even better. I recommend getting lost in the narrow alleys to look at the small shops, sipping tea, having a snack here and there, enjoying local life and grabbing all the photo opportunities you can think of.\n\nIf your time in the city is limited, you may want to go on one or two guided tours to make the most of it.\n\nReaching the Atlas Mountains and the beginning of the trail\n\nIt takes about one hour by car (or two on a combination of local buses and shared taxi) to get from Marrakech to Amizmiz, where your hike will start. Afribadger will take care to arrange your transfer.\n\nWhen to go hiking in Morocco Atlas Mountains\n\nThe best time to visit Morocco Atlas Mountains is between March and November, when there is no snow. Summer months tend to be hot, though much cooler than in the rest of Morocco. I generally don't recommend hiking in the summer, so if you are planning a hiking trip to the Atlas you should go between March and May, before it gets too hot; or in October and November, before it starts snowing.\n\nI visited Morocco and hiked the Atlas Mountains in mid April and days were sunny, with pleasant temperatures that dropped at night, when it became rather cold and warm clothes were a must.\n\nAnother factor to keep in mind is Ramadan, a month during which Muslims fast during the day. Personally, I wouldn't recommend visiting at that time of the year - mostly out of respect for locals who will be fasting. In 2020, Ramadan will be between April and May.\n\nSeveral companies organized hikes throughout the Atlas Mountains, but I can only comment the one I used.\n\nMy multi-day hike in Morocco was organized by Afribadger, a new tour operator which strives to promote responsible adventure travel and whose mission is to connect travelers with indigenous communities throughout the world, whether they want to travel alone, with friends or want to join an already formed group.\n\nVia the Afribadger app you'll be able to find information about the indigenous communities you may want to visit, read the itinerary of the trip, see if there is a tour leaving and book it. You will also be able to share your experience - much like on other social media - with photos and posts.\n\nBefore I go on to describe what your accommodation will be like while hiking in Morocco, let me reassure you that the lack of comfort during the hike will be made up by the incredible company of like minded people and by the smiles of the local families, who will go our of their way to make you feel welcome (I don't think I have ever met such, and of their children who are absolutely adorable.\n\nThroughout your hike in Morocco Atlas Mountains, accommodation will be pre-arranged for you and you will be sleeping in tiny Berber villages, in local homes which are very modest by our standards, but where families often rent out one or two rooms (usually the living room) to visitors and prepare their meals.\n\nWhile the food is delicious throughout, the sleeping arrangements are modest, but in a way they contribute to creating a special bond with among the group members.\n\n![](image\u002F75)\n\nDon't expect any luxury: you'll be provided a sleeping bag and some blankets to keep you warm at night, and you're likely going to sleep either on the floor on thin mattresses, or on the (very hard) couches. Usually, the entire group shares the room. During my hike, we slept in a bed (with our sleeping bags on tops, as linen was not provided) only on the last night of the trek.\n\nNone of the houses where you'll be staying will have a bathroom as you know it. In most cases, you'll have a squat toilet and, at best, a sink to wash your hands and brush your teeth - in some cases not even that.\n\nShowers are not a thing in the villages of the Atlas Mountains - you'll be able to use a traditional hammam a couple of times, and that will feel enormously recharging.\n\nMake the life of those mules as easy as possible by packing light.\n\nThe first thing you should consider when packing for a hiking trip to Morocco is that you have to be comfortable during the day, and comfortable and warm at night. You also have to show respect for the local customs. While women won't be asked to cover their head, both men and women should be dressed modestly, covering their shoulders, chest and legs - much like locals do.\n\nThis packing guide reflects the fact that you won't really have a chance to shower and get changed that much - keep whatever you pack at a minimum, and please remember that mules will be the ones carrying most of the weight and you should strive to make their lives as easy as possible.\n\nTry not to carry more than 7 kg with you - spread between your daypack and the backpack that the mules will be carrying.\n\nHaving said so, there are some items you should take with you and some things you are better off leaving in storage at your hotel in Marrakech.\n\nHere's what you should take:\n\nWet wipes - you'll need them to wash yourself, your face, your hands any time water is not readily available (which will be often). Hand sanitizer - for the reasons I have just said. A small bar of soap - for the one time you'll be able to use the hammam. Deodorant. A hat, a scarf and gloves. Good hiking boots such as Salomon 4D 3 GTX A pair of flip flops or, even better, walking sandal so that you can rest your feet at the end of the day. A pair of hiking pants (which you'll wear during the day) and a pair of leggings to wear at night. For pants, I love Kuhl Cliffside Convertible. Three t-shirts - one to wear, one as a change of clothes, one to wear at night. I am a fan of the Kuhl Sora&lt; t-shirt and the Kuhl Wunderer shirt, both long sleeves. For short sleeves, you can opt for something like Kuhl Kyra and Kuhl Sora. A fleece such as Kuhl Alska and a good jacket such as Firefly Hoody. A daypack such as Osprey Daylite Plus which you will carry during the day, and a slightly larger one such as Osprey Tempest 40. A refillable water bottle, with a filter, such as Lifestraw A small quick-dry towel. A change or two of underwear and socks.\n\nAnd here what you should leave in storage at your hotel in Marrakech:\n\nShampoo, conditioner, make up - you'll honestly be lucky if you have a chance to use the hammam, and if you do so, you have to keep it quick. Anything dressy, jeans, nice shoes - you won't have a chance of wearing any of that. Laptop - you won't have any opportunity to plug it in! Swimsuit.\n\nThere will be many occasions as you will be hiking in Morocco that will make you raise your eyebrow in disbelief or concern. Below are a few things you should consider, and a few easy things you can do to encourage change.\n\nUsing mules to carry weights is a common practice in Morocco, and part of the local culture. Chances are that even though you may decide to carry your backpack throughout the hike, mules will accompany the group to carry things such as sleeping bags, toilet paper and even bottles of water.\n\nThe easiest thing to do to make the life of these animals easier is to pack as little as possible and to ask the local company who is in charge of organizing the logistical support to not carry water, and suggest that you'll be using a water filter such as life straw for your water bottle, which you can refill regularly.\n\nDespite the fact that Morocco is doing better than the neighboring countries when it comes to renewable energy, there is little doubt that it has major issues when it comes to waste disposal.\n\nYou'll probably notice that there are various often very close to the villages you'll be walking through. Waste collection is sadly not a thing in the most remote villages of Morocco Atlas Mountains and more often than not the only way to get rid of waste is to burn it - with terrible consequences for the environment, and toxic effect to the air.\n\nWhile recycling waste policies have yet to be implemented in Morocco there are a couple of things you can do to minimize your impact - the main being to avoid using plastic. Using a filter for your water bottle is one of them, so that you can avoid buying plastic bottles.\n\nThe Amazigh are nothing short of welcoming. In each village you will be visiting throughout this hiking itinerary, you'll meet with local families - not only the ones where you will be having lunch or where you'll be sleeping, but also their neighbors, relatives, as well as small shop owners. They will all show curiosity towards the visitors, and an interest in interacting.\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\nThe Amazigh are Sunni muslims, both men and women wear traditional clothes; their main source of income is cattle and agriculture (which is why they share worries for climate change, as it emerged in conversation my group had with them); they live in clay houses with little modern comforts; and donkeys and mules are often the only means of transportation they use to move from one village to the other.\n\nThe language barrier (the communities you'll be visiting speak Tamazigh, and only on occasion they will know a few words of French) will be such that you will need your guide to act as interpreter - that's why having a good guide is fundamental.\n\nMake sure to ask show respect for the Amazigh at all times, by dressing modestly and by asking for permission to take photos - you'll soon realize that most people are happy to pose for photos.\n\nInteracting with local children.\n\nAs you cross the villages of the Atlas Mountains, you'll meet many children. They are , welcoming and absolutely funny, and they will want to show you their tricks and play with you. They will also ask you for presents - small things such as pens, or - more often - candy or snacks.\n\nI encourage you not to give children things that may have a detrimental effect for their health - I saw lots of children with cavities and very bad teeth - or to the environment. Chances are that if you offer them a snack, they will unwrap it immediately and throw the plastic wherever they are.\n\nA better idea may be to make a donation to the school - books, paper, pens and even money would be welcome.\n\nWhile alcohol is easily available in Marrakech, where all the best restaurants and hotels serve wine, beer and cocktails, this is absolutely not a thing among the Berber communities that live in the Atlas. You'll be drinking water, a lot of Moroccan tea and the occasional (instant) coffee.\n\nI always recommend getting a good travel insurance, wherever you go and even more so if you are going on a long distance hike!\n\nYou can find more information on this itinerary for hiking in Morocco, quotes for the trip and even get a chance to join a group or put together one on Afribadger app.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: I was a guest of the Afribadger during my trip to Morocco and I was thrilled to be one of the first to test this itinerary. Needless to say, the views expressed in this post remain my own.\n\nCLAUDIA TAVANI\n\n[My Adventures Across the World](https:\u002F\u002Fmyadventuresacrosstheworld.com\u002F)\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECopyright photos Claudia Tavani\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "Tourism and Sustainable Development",
                text: "Culture can be a driver of sustainable development, as it is defined by the United Nations 2030 Agenda, especially if it is linked to tourism and its impact. The tourism sector has become over the years one of the main drivers of social and economic change in many different countries, both in cities, in rural and in remote areas. The tourist attractiveness is recognized to bring positive impacts such as income, employment, revenues and recognition to territories. Tourism acts in fact as a driver of attractivity, innovation and communities identity empowerment.\n\nHowever, tourism pressure also could bring negative impacts on the area, especially with respect to the local inhabitants. While indeed tourism has generated new opportunities, its development may cause potential concerns on the local communities and the environment. Firstly, tourism pressure has created sustainability problems over natural resources and cities. Secondly, often there is an unequal participation in the benefits deriving from the economic growth driven by tourism. Tourism is a sector of investments of international company in accommodation facilities, it offers a fairly high proportion of low-skilled jobs, thus also not remunerated in an appropriate manner, it is not always accompanied by the enhancement of local productions, both in terms of food and beverage, but above all in terms of artisan production.\n\nIn general, it is recognized that tourism is a source of income, as it generates direct and indirect employment for local people (from transportation to constructions, to the accommodation business to sites maintenance). As for negative site impacts from tourism, some of them include damage to monuments and environmental degradation, traffic congestion and air pollution, littering and inappropriate parking, and degraded pathways. On another side, local communities also have many concerns about the integrity of some traditions and cultural practices, inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour, and displacement, as visitors increasingly dominate the landscape.\n\nThese are the constraints to bear in mind to make touristic sites effective drivers of local sustainable development.\n\n![](image\u002F80)\n\nTo sum up these are some actions to consider in managing areas who want to develop a community-based tourism:\n\n- Connect the sites with local cultural production (performing arts, handcraft, contemporary arts, etc.);\n- Connect tourism strategies with projects of local cultural production;\n- Improve the accessibility and usability for tourists (tools, services, accommodations, and facilities for the visit);\n- Increase a positive visitor experience (identification and management of activities that could increase the perceived quality of the visit and make an impact on the satisfaction of the tourists, for example thanks to the connection with the local cultural milieu);\n- Reduce impacts: prevent or minimize the impacts from tourism on the sites, by redirecting visitor flows, and thus relieve pressure on main destinations;\n- Create incentives for local operators, and change and improve existing systems, products and experiences to reduce site impacts and benefit local people.\n- Engage, through regular communication, consultation and collaboration, between and within the main stakeholders, which are government, industry, NGOs and local communities. It is important that all stakeholders interact with each other for integrated management to work.\n- Empower of local communities: greater participation in tourism operations by local communities should be fostered, so as to provide direct economic benefits and alleviate rural poverty, especially in less-known or remote destinations.\n\nThe community-based tourism could be considered a type of tourism in which to invest in the future, with positive impact for local community to generate economic benefits through offering local products, lifestyles, natural resources and cultures.\n\n**Santagata Foundation for the Economics of Culture**\n\n**\u003Csup\u003EFondazione Santagata\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E**\u003Csup\u003E operates in the framework of international cultural policies and guidelines.

                title: "Visiting Indigenous Tribes is a Life-Changing Experience For Them Too",
                text: 'The trend of adventure travel is evolving in recent years from the pure search for adrenaline to inner transformation, learning about other cultures and experiences that fill the soul. Indigenous tourism, also known as ethnic or tribal tourism, is a particularly rapid growth trend.\n\nFor people like me, who have had the immense luck of living this type of travels and experiencing a significant interaction with other cultures, these tours have been impressively rewarding.\n\nHowever, with the rapid increase in travelers in recent years, it is important to define how to make visits to indigenous tribes ethical so that they become positive consequences for the preservation of lifestyles, native traditions and their economical sustainability.\n\n![](image\u002F35)\n\nFirst of all, indigenous tourism travelers should be aware that their commitment to local communities must be genuine and, no matter if the experience lasts one or more days, they should make a true cultural immersion instead of simply making specific stops in the native villages just to take some photos as if it were a human zoo.\n\nIn fact, on my trip to Namibia to visit the extraordinary Himba tribe, I understood firsthand the great importance of making an effort to leave a positive impact on their community and how the way you approach and treat the natives becomes a life-changing experience for them too.\n\n![](image\u002F33)\n\nAfter four days of travel through one the most amazing and diverse landscapes on earth, our group camped in tents next to a small Himba village, located in Himbaland in northern Namibia, very close to the border with Angola. From the first moment, we mixed with the locals and showed them our interest in learning their culture and traditions, as well as letting them know that we would love to tell them about our way of life if they were interested. The experience was even more amazing than we thought. For three days, each of us became friends with different members of the community. While some of us learned to extract water for consumption, others learned to make crafts, to use mud to cover our faces, to care for cattle. But not only that, we were able to establish sincere dialogues on how we think about transcendental issues such as education, religion, climate change or marriage, and all this from deep respect and mutual admiration.\n\nWe also had time to celebrate together, organize firelight dinners and perform traditional dances. We taught each other how we dance, how we cook, and even how we have fun!\n\n![](image\u002F34)\n\nAnd with that confidence they told us that until the moment we arrived they had a very different impression of foreigners. They saw them as people without empathy and disrespectful who just wanted to take pictures and did not even approach them to have a simple friendly conversation.\n\n**What is the difference between the impact of our trip and those of other travelers?**\n\nClearly, we reaffirmed to them the importance of their traditions and their way of thinking. We made them realize that we are equal and at the same time that our differences make us unique. They learned how rewarding is respectful intercultural exchange. But, above all, our visit was a real economic impact for them. The simple fact of paying for the goats we shared, bringing them basic food or buying their handicrafts was a great help and a hope for them to find a new way to make a living. Logically, a single group of tourists will not change their lives, but if it becomes a controlled flow, they could find a sustainable way of life that will take them out of poverty, help them have access to decent health and many other positive effects to their daily life.\n\n![](image\u002F38)\n\nWhen someone raises the dilemma of whether visiting indigenous tribes can help them or contribute to their exploitation, we should think that in many communities the only alternative for locals to make a living is usually labor-intensive agriculture or depending on the government and NGOs -and when this happens in countries affected by extreme poverty or climate change, this is no longer even possible-. I would say to them that "doing the right thing" is traveling with operators who follow a strict code of conduct as Afribadger and its partners on destination. In this way they ensure that payments go directly to the indigenous peoples and their trips are ethical, responsible, a true cultural immersion and most likely a unique and memorable experience for the traveler and the indigenous community.\n\n\u003Csup\u003EPhotos: Javier Salinas Copyright: Afribadger\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                title: "Good Memories of Egypt: Desert Camping With The Bedouins",
                text: "The sky was black and millions of stars were overhead; suddenly the moon was rising from behind the rocky hills of the golden desert of Wadi El Gamal, while me and a small group of lucky volunteers were laying on the dry soil. It was our last night at the camp.\n\n![](image\u002F23)\n\nThe end of the experience finally arrived, and after saying goodbye to most of the fellow volunteers, the few of us that decided to stay for another night went back to our tents. Just a few of us were left; just hours before we could count dozens of people sitting and walking everywhere.\n\nWe all decided we were not going to sleep in the tent tonight. We’d been waiting for this opportunity, and finally the night was all ours. Hazem, a volunteer who quickly became a friend, and I, took our sleeping bags, laid them against the side of the main tent, and played Arabic music on our radio, in a very low volume. Someone lit a fire and the dog named “Khawaga” (translated to “foreigner”) circled the sleeping bags before sitting. The shooting stars hunt began, and there were only winners. I was enchanted by the fantastic panorama—the campfire on one side and the deserted valley in front of me. The Egyptian tribes that had traveled from across the country to meet here were already on the way back to their villages and oasis, some of them returning to remote places in the middle of the desert.\n\n![](image\u002F30)\n\nThe previous week had been intense and demanding – the weather was hot and there was a lot to do – but also rich in satisfaction.\n\nI was a foreigner who had just arrived in Egypt, I didn’t understand a word of Arabic, and I was suddenly surrounded by hundreds of Egyptian people that were organizing an event. I was the first Italian ever to take part in the Characters of Egypt Festival. It was late 2010.\n\n![](image\u002F26)\n\nNot sure if it still happens, but back then the Festival took place every year in different venues around Egypt. Here, Bedouins and tribes from different parts of the country gathered and camped together for three nights, sharing their culture, rituals and knowledge. Some of the tribes were completely unknown until the founder of the festival, Mr. Walid Ramadan, started traveling across Egypt attempting to discover lost and unknown populations. His effort was to persuade each tribe to participate in his grand project. Ramadan’s intentions were simple: to put a tribe with good skills in extracting water from the desert in contact with another tribe who lacked the skills; the tribes that were good at agriculture to shared their tips, and so on.\n\n![](image\u002F29)\n\nMy involvement in the process happened by chance as I was casually surfing Facebook I saw a video about the event. My imagination instantly took me to the venue. I decided I was going to attend the festival as a visitor, and I started to find out more information about transportation, not an easy task, as the camp of Wadi el Gamal is at about 150 km south from Marsa Alam. Around the same time I was trying to figure out how to do that, I met a woman named Rowan who I soon realized was associated with the Characters of Egypt Festival. Rowan told me I could volunteer with the organization in charge of organizing and assisting the event. That sounded just perfect! I had never volunteered, but for sure I dreamed about such an experience before, especially while abroad.\n\nAs a travel photographer and blogger I was assigned to the “press and documentation” committee. My task was to take photos of as many events as possible, and then at the end of each day I had to write a journal about what I saw, and of course share the images with the rest of the group. Other than this, my team and I had to take care of the needs of the press that came from across Egypt and many neighboring countries. Many of the professional photographers, video producers and journalists who came to the festival had no idea what Characters of Egypt was about – they were sent by their agencies to cover a basically unknown event that everyone ended up loving and will never forget.\n\n![](image\u002F31)\n\nProfessionally, the biggest satisfaction from the experience was having my photographs published in a very well known Egyptian magazine named Campus Mag. I couldn’t believe it when they called me to ask me for some of my shots. If everything else wasn’t enough, I also have a tangible memory of those days, like a trophy that I took home with me and another reason to be proud of taking part in such a project.\n\nBefore this experience, when I thought about Egypt I imagined pyramids, camels and desert. Only a few people know about the existence of tribes or ever had a conversation with a Bedouin or know anything about their lifestyle. Thanks to Facebook (it reached the oases, too!) I am still in contact with some members of the tribesmen I met in Egypt. In only a few days I discovered the beauty of camping in the desert and developed a strong interest in eco-tourism. I realized how many opportunities volunteering can give me and everyone in our pursuit to understand other cultures. I had the chance to get involved in the heart of the culture, allowing me to meet locals inside their community: not as a tourist\u002Flocal in a detached relationship, but rather as a team of people living side by side, eventually beginning new friendships. The people I met at the Characters of Egypt Festival are still some of my best friends in Egypt and were the ones that nine months later took me to the airport when I left.\n\n![](image\u002F31)\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECopyright photos: Giulia Cimarosti\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "8 Things You Should Know Before Visiting the Fulani",
                text: 'The Fulani community is a crucial nomadic ethnic group in the African continent, and it is safe to say that every each of them has its particularities and traditions. You might have already read the famous *“Pulaaku”*, or code of behaviour of the Fulani; however, you might find yourself a little confused. As important as the British Royal Etiquette, it is better to prepare before arriving at your host community to avoid any misunderstanding or embarrassing moments! In this article, we will discover more in-depth the Fulani community of Senegal that you can visit with Afribadger, and adhere to the “*Fulani Way”* even before taking off!\n\nMany indigenous communities all over the globe have developed their code of behaviour to ensure a peaceful life and a standard for etiquette.\n\nThe Fulani are very proud of their own code which varies from nation to nation, and is central to their lives. It is called *“Pulaaku”*, and it can be considered to be the decorum, chivalry and good manners of a Fulani person. It is so intricate that sometimes it makes it hard for some people to enact *“Pulaaku”* all day, but the rules are followed for the majority of public interactions.\n\n#### Virtues are essentials for a Fulani person.\n\n![](image\u002F352)\n\nPrudence, respect, self-control, mental discipline and modesty are a lifestyle. The *“Fulani way”* also includes four essential character traits that every Fulani should have: “*munyal”* (patience, self-control, discipline), “*hakkiilo”* (wisdom, forethought), “*semteende”* (modesty, respect), “*sagata”* (courage, hard work).\n\n#### The Fulani are excellent hosts.\n\n![](image\u002F353)\n\nThey deeply believe in giving hospitality and helping others, while keeping total control of their emotions and impulses at all times. If a Fulani person is feeling physical or emotional pain or general discomfort, it is imperative not to show it in public at all cost.\n\n#### *Pulaaku*, the Fulani code of behaviour.\n\n![](image\u002F350)\n\nSmoking, drinking, killing, or committing adultery are not *“Pulaaku”*. If someone breaks the Code of Behaviour (s), they are judged by the community based on a scale of violation of the *“Pulaaku”*. Although violence is not contemplated in the *“Pulaaku”*, self-defence is somehow acceptable.\n\n#### Cattle are part of the Fulani families.\n\nThey provide wealth and food to the Fulani family. They tend to have a very close relationship with the animals and some of them are given names. The cattle provide to Fulani members a chance to show that they have *“Pulaaku”* because they believe that the animals enhance the interaction among families.\n\n#### Not asking for help is honorable to the Fulani.\n\n*"Semteende"* is the quality of being "shy" or "humble". Asking for anything should be embarrassing and therefore the Fulani are always self-sufficient. Asking a favor or asking to share food would be a great shame in front of the rest of the community. But in the event that a courteous favor has to be accepted, the Fulani must show immense gratitude.\n\n#### Religion is vital.\n\n![](image\u002F349)\n\nThe Fulani religion is largely Islamic and most adhere to at least some of its basic requirements. The union between religion and code of conduct makes it even more important to follow all the rules of behavior to be accepted in the community. It is important to know the basic codes of Islam before enjoying a few days with the Fulani. When visiting you should be dressed accordingly to avoid as well breaking the *“Pulaaku”* and offending anyone.\n\n#### Personal adornment to attract the future wife.\n\n![](image\u002F348)\n\nIf you see Fulani men with red ocher on their faces, white ostrich feathers on their headdresses and white beaded necklaces on their chests, you are attending the *gerewol*, the Fulani beauty pageant where the girls choose the most handsome Fulani man. To attract women, men dance by exaggerating their facial expressions. Both men and women paint their lips and the rims of the eyes black to highlight the whiteness of their teeth and eyes.\n\n#### The Fulani Art, symbol of social status.\n\n![](image\u002F351)\n\nFulani art is represented in a variety of ways such as decorated gourds and textiles with geometric shapes as motifs with many details. The use of black, red, yellow and white predominates. Painted gourds are an important part of a woman\'s social and economic status. Women\'s hairstyles, to which they add silver picks and other accessories, are also an artistic form that also allows them to carry objects on their heads.\n\nDiscover more about the Fulani in our tribes section.\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nCover photo Fulani women, iStock.com\u002F[obertonencini](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fes\u002Fportfolio\u002Frobertonencini?mediatype=photography)',

                title: "Heading North? What to Pack for Afribadger's Polar Destinations",
                text: "#### The Art of Layering\n\nSome people prefer spending their adventures in the warmth of the Caribbean, or trekking in the humid forests of South East Asia, however, some peoples' compasses might head north, exceptionally north. Instead of tropical mellow golden sunsets, they prefer the Land of the Midnight Sun, where the Sami Tribe in Norway lives, or they might prefer being captured by the mystical Northern Lights of the Aurora Borealis, while visiting the Komi in Sweden.\n\nPacking a couple of bikinis is not the same as few pieces of heavy and technical clothes that could potentially save your life, especially if you are going to visit the Nenets and the Yakut in Siberia, or even the Inuit in Northern America, where temperatures are below zero.\n\nThe perfect way to keep you warm and dry during these adventures is by mastering the art of layering, that will work for every inch of your body, from head to toe. Besides, you will most probably have only one chance to put into practice this technique, as it will be challenging ever to have the occasion to change your outfit!\n\nUsually, thermal gear is essential in this type of climates; however, Merino Wool can be a great sustainable alternative to synthetic clothes that will last you a long time, and it is polar-approved. This wool is well known for its incredible resilience and adaptability, and it does not itch! It keeps the body warm by providing the perfect insulation while making sure to keep the body dry despite the natural moisture. It has antimicrobial properties, it does not collect sweat, and it does not provide the environment for bacteria to grow. It also repels odours, and it is very lightweight, making it perfect for longer adventures during which changing occasions will be rare or even inexistent. Merino wool is sold with different ‘weights’ according to its thickness; needless to say, go with the heaviest! In general, cotton is forbidden in polar expeditions, as it won’t keep you warm at all, so don’t waste your precious packing space.\n\nDown below you can find a short list of essentials to include in your backpack while travelling during colder months to the Afribadger's polar destinations and to enjoy your adventure at its full potential (while avoiding frostbites!).\n\n![](image\u002F337)\n\n*Thermal socks*, as well as some Merino wool ones and some *thermal underpants* to keep your privates warm and protected! Also, pack some thermal *mid-layer pants* which you will then cover with a pair of *waterproof* and *insulated* ones, like polar ski pants. Consider trousers with a drop seat to ease up the “going to the toilet in -40°C in nature” procedure.\n\nSame layering technique goes for the upper body: thermal or Merino Wool *long sleeves undershirt*, to insulate you and to wick away moisture to keep you dry and warm, topped with another *thermal shirt*. Go on then with a light *fleece jacket* to ensure the insulation is locked in and complete everything with what is going to be your first jacket. We suggest an *expedition quality down jacket*, but you can choose whatever you feel like is going to do the trick, however, always designed for polar conditions. Protip: reindeer hair is incredibly hard to remove from fleece items, so keep the two separated at all times!\n\nThen, it is time for arguably the most essential item in your backpack, a *winter coat.*\n\n#### The winter coat!\n\nYou need to find the heaviest on the market, able to bear every low temperature, rain, snow and wind. Often these are a little bit on the expensive side but are an investment piece that could save your life during the coldest of days, and you could easily reuse it for another Afribadger polar adventure.\n\n![](image\u002F334)\n\nDo not forget to *cover your ears*, *head* and bring a *balaclava* that you will always keep raised above the nose and mouth to stop them from freezing, even from the moisture of your breath. Remember: in many polar experiences, the mean of transportation is the reindeer sledge, during which the icy wind is going to feel on your face. The nose is one of the first victims of frostbite along with hands and feet's toes.\n\nIf you see the nose of one of your adventure friends going a waxy white colour, warn them immediately as it could be the sign of early frostbite. It also might be particularly useful while visiting the Nenets and the Yakut in Siberia where temperatures drop quickly.\n\nGood quality waterproof *gloves* (inner and outer gloves with reinforced palms) and *boots* are essentials. Pack felted snow boots, waterproof, lightweight and in general, the warmer you can find. We suggest going one size up since you will pack very heavy socks and they will reduce the space inside the shoe. Keep in mind, if you tighten your boots too much, you will cut the blood's circulation and the air trapped inside will work as an insulator making your feet colder. Consider bringing some body heat patches - they are very helpful self-adhesive pads that provide heat for any part of the body. The air-activation releases a reaction heat that lasts up to 8 hours and can reach a warm temperature.\n\n![](image\u002F336)\n\nIn some cases of extreme cold - and this may not be valid for all travelers, although it must be accepted as an ancestral tradition - tribes that live with reindeer such as the Nenets, can sacrifice one of these animals from their herds to warm themselves by feeding with its nourishing meat.\n\nMake sure to remember also plenty of *sunscreens* and *lip salve with UV protection;* the reflection of the sun on the snow makes it more potent, and you could end up with a nasty sunburn and chapped lips. Pack also *ski goggles* and\u002For *polarized sunglasses*. Bring also an insulated water bottle to keep your liquids, well, fluid.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed by the layers you have to pack, or even worried to have forgotten something at home, Afribadger's polar guides will assist you. They will provide you with whatever you might need to feel comfortable, warm and safe. This could potentially mean that you will have to wear in some local traditional handmade gear that will last you a lifetime, and most probably will keep you warmer than any technical gear on the market! It might include some reindeer-hair undergarment… Who knows?\n\n![](image\u002F338)\n\n![](image\u002F339)\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information in this article is for general information purpose only. It does not intend to substitute any detailed gear list you will receive by Afribadger before leaving for your polar destination, including Sami Tribe in Norway, Komi in Sweden, Nenets and the Yakut in Siberia, and Inuit in Alaska. Take polar expeditions seriously and pack accordingly!\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nCover photo. \"Afribadger expeditioner in Nenetland\" by Javier Salinas",

                title: "10 Curiosities About Newar People From Nepal",
                text: 'Have you ever heard about the Newar people? They are the original inhabitants of Kathmandu valley in Nepal and the creators of the historic heritage and civilization of this beautiful region. Let’s discover together where they live, what they eat and some curiosities about their traditional habits. You will, for sure, consider the idea of visiting them and experience a life-changing journey!\n\n#### Newars and their wonderful habitat\n\n![](image\u002F305)\n\nThe Newari are a mixed ethnic minority of Tibetans and Indians who, for centuries, have inhabited the beautiful hills near the Himalayas. Their stronghold is the Kathmandu valley, but the Newars are careful to distinguish themselves from the other peoples of the hills. Although they are an ethnic minority, their majority presence in the valley has allowed them to exercise a strong cultural influence.\n\n#### Social distancing is nothing new for Newar people\n\nWe sadly become familiar with the concept of "social distancing", recommended for all of us in the current emergency circumstances… but Newars used to practice this since centuries: among their unique rituals and traditions is the practice of imposing "isolation" upon newcomers to the valley.\n\n#### Newar girls and the unusual marriage\n\n![](image\u002F309)\n\nThe tradition of Newar people wants girls to be married three times: the first one with a bael fruit, also known as wood apple, to protect them if the future husband dies. The second one to the Sun and finally they get married to a man. The Newari girls also go through the Bara ceremony or ( *Gufa rakhne*) as a symbol of ascension to womanhood.\n\n#### Hindu or Buddhist Newari?\n\nNewari religion is exceptionally diversified and complex: individual Newars may identify themselves as either Hindu or Buddhist, depending on their historical origin. This fact will only make little difference in their fundamental doctrines or practices. Beyond religion, kinship roles are significant to Newars and reinforced by elaborate life-cycle rituals and annual feasts and festivals.\n\n#### The importance of 77, 1000 months, 88, 99 and 110 years\n\n*Jankhu* is a traditional ritual done when a person reaches the age of 77, 1000 months, 88, 99 and 110 years to celebrate her or his survival. The real reason why these specific years must be asked directly to them. After death, a ritual called *Shraddha* is done. During this ritual death is mourned by the dead person\'s relatives for 13 days by wearing white clothes: this will help him to remain pure. In the Upper Mustang and Dolpo, sky burial is carried out and the body left to be eaten by vultures and crows.\n\n#### Newari cultural heritage: stone sculptures, temples, pagoda-style roof and UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\n![](image\u002F308)\n\nBuddhist stupas (*shrines*) dating to the 3rd century bc are all that is left of the early cultures of the Kathmandu Valley. However, numerous magnificent stone sculptures survive from the subsequent Licchavi period, and you will see superb woodcarving, metalwork, and stone sculpture belonging to Mallas period in temples, palaces, and courtyards throughout the Kathmandu Valley. More: a Newari architect introduced in the late 13th century the valley\'s distinctive pagoda-style roof into Tibet: This kind of architecture was spread later to all the rest of East Asia. Also: in Kathmandu Valley, we can find seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites and 2,500 temples and shrines. These places deserve to be admired closely!\n\n#### Folk art crafts and hobbies\n\nMany of the traditional handicrafts of the Newar are based on religious objects and carved into stone and wood, such as statues of deities, prayer wheels, thankas (painted scrolls), Nepālī khukhrīs (curved knives), and paper maché dance masks. More utilitarian crafts include weaving, pottery, and basketry.\n\n#### Rice, meat and liquor to celebrate festivals\n\n![](image\u002F306)\n\nInter-caste celebrations are the main festivals of the Kathmandu Valley. These include many *Jatras*, when images of the deities are carried through the streets in procession, while rituals often include the sacrifice of buffalo or goats. All the Newari festivals used to be accompanied by a significant consumption of rice, meat, liquor, and home-made beer.\n\n#### **Newari love indoor sports and board games**\n\nThe majority of Newari sports and games tend to be indoor, and many include gambling. One example: *Kupi*, which involves betting on a coin tossed in a scoop. Cards appeal to both adults and young people, while upper classes love chess and other board games. Outdoor sports such as soccer are practised in Kathmandu and other big cities.\n\n#### Current and past entertainment and recreation\n\n![](image\u002F307)\n\nNewars have access to the modern amenities offered by the city of Kathmandu and other neighbouring cities, such as theatres that mostly show Indian films. At the same time, government-controlled radio and television programs are only available to those who can afford the receivers. It has to be said that many Newars still devote themselves to religious festivals and rich folk traditions including song, music and dance.\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nRead more about Newar tribe in our tribes section.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Newar couple iStock.com\u002F\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E[\u003Csup\u003EZzvet\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.istockphoto.com\u002Fportfolio\u002FZzvet?mediatype=photography)',

                title: "15 Things You Should Know Before Visiting the Tribes in Borneo",
                text: "If you have thought about traveling to Borneo to meet the tribes that live there, you are lucky! because in Afribadger you will find different experiences to visit them in very different ways such as trekking, cycling, boat and others. Therefore, you will surely like to read some remarkable facts about the amazing cultures that inhabit this region before you travel.\n\n#### The greatest Asia’s rainforest is located in Borneo.\n\n![](image\u002F280)\n\nIts landscape mixes with many other habitats such as mangroves, peat swamps, swampy forests, and large rivers, forming a unique ecosystem in the world and source of life for the tribes. Endangered animals such as orangutans, elephants and rhinos, among many other species, inhabit this environment.\n\n#### The cultural mosaic of indigenous tribes in Borneo is immense.\n\nThey represent 11% of the population. Many of the tribes live in the forests, many others live in the coastal areas, and most are spiritually linked to the rainforest.\n\n#### The tribes preserve their traditions.\n\nMost of the indigenous people are adopting the customs of contemporary life, but it is gratifying to discover, when visiting the country, that they continue to preserve their traditions and lifestyle.\n\n#### Shake hands to greet.\n\nKeep in mind that shaking hands between men or women is a normal custom, but be careful! a man cannot shake a woman's hand or vice versa. Between different sexes, a slight bow of the head can be done while placing a hand on the heart.\n\n#### Consider possible vaccinations.\n\nDepending on your plans while visiting Malaysia, you should consider talking to your doctor about some possible vaccinations. In rural areas, Malaria, Rabies, Dengue and Yellow fever can be present, however, bigger cities tend to be safer.\n\n#### Protect yourself from mosquitoes.\n\nIf you plan to go trekking and staying outdoors for long periods of time, we highly suggest you to reduce the risk of infection by protecting yourself from mosquito bites using repellents containing 30-50% DEET, usually harder to find in Malaysia and an easier find in the US, Europe and Australia.\n\n#### Lun Bawang tribe. Salt for the health.\n\n![](image\u002F291)\n\nWhile visiting the Lun Bawang people you will travel to the Buduk Bui Salt Spring and you will discover the traditional salt extraction tradition of the area. The indigenous community believe that each salt hill has its own nutritious value and benefits. According to their experience, the iodine in the salt helps the knee joints, the skin and cure thyroid problems. Make sure to pack up the salt and bring plenty back home! \u003Csup\u003ERead more about Lun Bawang tribe in our tribes section.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n#### Kejaman tribe, Sibu Central Market.\n\nWhile visiting the Kejaman you will also visit the Sibu Central Market. Here you will see all kinds of produces and you will also be able to buy some of the most exotic fruits, freshly picked from the forest by native people! Make sure to take with you small change to avoid going around with too much money, unfortunately pickpocketing is common. \u003Csup\u003ERead more about Kejaman tribe in our tribes section.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n#### Tattooing in the Kayan, Lahanan and Sekapan tribes.\n\n![](image\u002F279)\n\nThe Kayan, Lahanan and Sekapan share some similar customs, but unfortunately they are slowly disappearing. One of these tradition is tattooing, which was a very important activity in the tribes’ social life. Tattooists used to be the women’s profession and it was hereditary in the female line. Both men and women used to have protective arm, hands and fingers tattoos. In the past, this practice would take an entire day and over at least three weeks for both hands to be properly tattooed. Tattooing would normally take place before puberty to enhance the beauty of the Sekapan, Lahanan and Kayan girls and also to prepare them for meeting their future husbands.\n\n#### Melanau tribe, language tips and socialization.\n\nWhile staying with the tribe you can try to break the ice with some Melanau language! Let’s start with some greetings; Good morning: *Selamet suwap*; Good afternoon: *Selamet abei*; Good night: *Selamet malem*; How are you? *Inou dengah nou?* Unfortunately, the language is slowly disappearing and some parents are not teaching it to their kids, so your effort will be highly appreciated! If you want to learn more terms and expressions visit this [Melanau online dictionary](http:\u002F\u002Fmelanau.nativeglot.com\u002F.). \u003Csup\u003ERead more about Melanau tribe in our tribes section.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n#### Be aware of monkeys in National Parks.\n\n![](image\u002F290)\n\nWhile trekking in the Bako National Park and spotting the incredible wildlife you might feel like having a snack… Well, look around before opening your bag as monkeys are known to be very glutton and to steal food even from the hands of unaware hikers!\n\n#### Melanau manners and longhouse rules.\n\nAlmost all the indigenous communities in the area have the traditional longhouses in their village. To follow the Melanau etiquette, usually the traveller seeking shelter needed to firstly present themselves to the headman, that would arrange the sleeping arrangement. This tradition is now lost, however it is considered rude to turn up at a longhouse unannounced, especially since it is usually the family house.\n\n#### Penan tribe, watch out for hidden signs.\n\nThe Penan have developed an intricate communication code to leave small information in the forest for fellow tribe members wandering in nature. The codes are usually left for safety reasons indicating to the person possible obstacles or dangers ahead and conveying the message using sticks, leaves, and stones. \u003Csup\u003ERead more about Penan tribe in our tribes section.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\n#### Penan art of sharing.\n\n![](image\u002F282)\n\nThe Penan don’t have any word to say “thank you”, however, Jian kenin is the closest translation and it literally means “feel good”. To the Penans the lack of sharing is a serious insult and violation, but moderation is also important and you will never find a member abusing people’s generosity.\n\n#### Dayak people, (ex) headhunters.\n\nThe Dayak tribe were the original heirs to the Borneo land. Although they practiced agriculture, hunting and gathering, they were feared for their ferocious head-hunting practices, called Ngayau. The Dayak attributed supernatural powers to the heads of their enemies and used them in rituals to secure crops or bring good fortune to their homes. The members of the tribes acquired greater social rank with the greater number of heads collected. Don't worry, they no longer practice these rituals for many years! \u003Csup\u003ERead more about Dayak tribe in our tribes section.\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\n\nAfribadger TEAM",

                title: "11 Things to Know About Kyrgyz People Before Travelling to Kyrgyzstan",
                text: "Tourism has only recently begun to be more established in Kyrgyzstan, a relatively unknown country that can offer a lot in terms of culture, landscapes and events. Let's find out some of the main attractions and curiosity about Kyrgyz people together! If you are a curious traveller who wants to get off the most touristic sites, we suggest you start looking at flights!\n\n### **Culture and Events**\n\n**Yurts**\n\n![](image\u002F257)\n\nMany Kyrgyz people live a semi-nomadic way of life; they live in small towns and villages during winter while they set up camp in the *Jailoos* (alpine meadows) in summer. Being hosted in families' Yurts -A traditional yurt or ger is a portable, round tent covered with skins or felt and used as a dwelling by several distinct nomadic groups- is a unique experience to learn from them and participate in their daily life. While Yurt exteriors are usually grey and monotone, the interiors are traditionally flush with colour and warmth.\n\n*Shyrdaks*, hand-stitched felt carpets, typically cover both floor and sidewalls of a yurt. They are used as decoration and insulation (provided by heavy wool). Their colours and designs are full of symbolism and meaning.\n\n**World Nomad Games**\n\n![](image\u002F256)\n\nWorld Nomad Games are held in Cholpon Ata every two years and include 16 traditional games and sports. It's the Olympics games for Central Asian nomad culture. Central Asia is the birthplace of the ancient tradition of eagle hunting, and Kyrgyz are masters in this, having passed this tradition from generation to generation. Witnessing the World Nomad Games can reveal much of the Kyrgyz people tradition and culture.\n\n**Mountain Music**\n\n![](image\u002F252)\n\nPolicies of the Soviet state have contributed to the disappearance of many cultural nomad activities of Kyrgyz peoples', but it seems that during the last 20 years and after the independence of the country, traditional music and arts have been making a comeback. One example: the Switzerland-based Aga Khan Foundation supports 70 musicians across Kyrgyzstan who study traditional music with older masters. That style of music is strictly linked to the daily life tradition: the strings of qyl-qiyak, a violin-like instrument, are made from a horse’s tail. Kyrgyz used to ride horses everywhere as part of their nomad life.\n\n**Kyrgyz Burana Tower**\n\n![](image\u002F253)\n\nKyrgyzstan Burana Tower, dating to the 10th century, was a lookout for the city of Balasagyn, a big ancient medieval village. Fortunately, it was not destroyed at the arrival of Genghis Khan's Mongols, and it has been preserved to this day. One suggestion: climb the 25-meter-high tower through the interior staircase to finally see the panoramic view from the top. An experience not to be missed!\n\n**Food and Drink**\n\n![](image\u002F254)\n\nIf you like barbecued meats, noodles, flavour and spices, then Kyrgyzstan is the country for you! Tea drinking is a massive part of the culture and an occasion to share time with people too. There are often rituals on how the tea is served, who serve it, but often incomprehensible to outsiders so…follow the flow and enjoy the moment!\n\n### **Tips and Curiosity**\n\n**Forty: Kyrgyz’s Favourite Number**\n\n“Kyrgyz” probably comes from the Turkic word “forty”, a reference to the 40 ancestral clans, and the country’s flag features a 40-ray sun too. So the number 40 has a special meaning for Kyrgyz people and is often seen as a kind of lucky charm.\n\n**Land of Ladas**\n\nLadas are Russian-made cars that persist in Kyrgyzstan after the USSR disbanded. They are singular and cute, especially in electric yellow. More than this, they represent a part of the country's history.\n\n**Easy Country to Visit**\n\nKyrgyzstan is visa-free for 45 countries for up to 60 days, making it the easiest of the Central Asian countries to visit as a tourist.\n\n### What about Nature?\n\n**Mountains and Lakes**\n\n![](image\u002F255)\n\nMountains cover the country for more than 90% of the surface and peaks can touch even 7,000 meters. A perfect place for hikers, as hiring guides, porters and horses to head into the hills are very affordable. Mountain lakes are about 2000 in Kyrgyzstan: Kyrgyzstan's Issyk Kul Lake is the world’s second-largest lake in high-alpine environments. The surrounding of the lake is a UNESCO \"biosphere reserve\", and it ranges from desert to alpine tundra, and hosts endangered animals such as snow leopards and Ovis ammon polii (“Marco Polo sheep”).\n\n**Walnut-Fruit Forest**\n\nKyrgyzstan has the world’s largest stands of walnut-fruit forests. You can find them in the western part of the country where it is possible to see walnuts growing alongside apples, pistachios and other crops suited to the dry climate. Thanks, to the Swiss government, attempted to help Kyrgyzstan in reforming its Soviet-designed forestry sector introducing walnut-fruit forests between 1995 to 2010.\n\n**Three Unesco World Heritage sites**\n\n![](image\u002F258)\n\nThe Tien-Shan mountain range, the network of routes that made up the historic Silk Road and the Sulayman Mountain on the outskirts of Osh are the three UNESCO sites of the country. UNESCO mentions it as \"a complete example of a sacred mountain anywhere in Central Asia\". See and believe!\n\nAfribadger TEAM\n\nPlan your trip checking out the Kyrgyz in our Tribes section.\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo Kyrgyz Hunter Eagle \u003C\u002Fsup\u003E[\u003Csup\u003EiStock.com\u002Fugurhan\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E](http:\u002F\u002FiStock.com\u002Fugurhan)",

                title: "17 Curious Facts You Should Know Before Visiting The Nenets",
                text: 'For many reasons, the Nenets are one of the most fascinating cultures in the world. Perhaps the most striking thing being their ability to adapt their lives to the most challenging climate in the Northern Hemisphere, and a mutual dependence between communities and their reindeer.\n\nMuch has been written about them, but very few people have had the opportunity to visit, and having lived with one of the Nenet families during the winter period, the Afribadger team uncovered 17 curious facts that you won’t often find mentioned in books.\n\n#### Nenets live on the edge of the world.\n\n![](image\u002F247)\n\nNenets inhabit the northern part of the western Siberian plain. This includes the ‘Yamal’ peninsula, which is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean, and in Nenet language means "the edge of the world".\n\n#### Nenets have lived with reindeer for one thousand years.\n\nEvidence of indigenous peoples being dedicated to the reindeer economy in the Yamal Peninsula dates back a thousand years. Nenets were originally hunters, but for centuries specialized in the domestication of reindeer, which created a bond in which they were mutually dependent on each other for survival.\n\n#### Nenets can recognize an individual reindeer in a herd of thousands.\n\nFor most people, all reindeer look practically the same, but the Nenets can recognize individual animals among dozens of different types and within herds of thousands. In the Nenet language there is a different word to identify each and every one of those thousands of reindeer.\n\n#### Every Nenet family has a sacred reindeer.\n\nThe sacred reindeer of each family cannot pull a sled or be sacrificed under any circumstances (the exception to the latter being when old age means they are no longer able to walk). The animal is treated like a member of the family and lives — alongside other pets such as sheepdogs —around their home throughout its life.\n\n#### The Nenets\' entire existence depends on reindeer.\n\nReindeer provide everything the Nenets need to survive. Their skins serve to cover their homes — the ‘Chum’ — and protect them from the cold. The Nenets\' coats, boots and blankets are made from their fur, with the seams constructed using the animal\'s nerves. Bones are used to make utensils and sled parts, and of course its meat, which can be eaten raw, boiled or frozen, is a primary component of their diet. Their blood is specifically valued as a rich source of vitamins, and is drunk immediately after slaughtering the reindeer.\n\n#### Nenets use carved mammoth ivory to create utensils.\n\nMammoths were giant woolly elephants that lived during the Pleistocene — some hundreds of thousands of years ago — in Siberia. When the thaw occurs, the permafrost uncovers the bones of these animals, which the Nenets then find when they take the reindeer to graze and carve into utensils and decorative elements.\n\n#### Even when it’s minus 50 degrees Celsius outside, inside the Chum, the temperature is still like summer.\n\n![](image\u002F132)\n\nChums are the homes of the Nenets. They are built by erecting a skeleton of fir wood posts and covering it in reindeer skins: a construction which can be assembled and disassembled in less than two hours. While outside temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius can be reached in winter, inside the Chum the thermal insulation of the reindeer skin keeps the temperature warm and pleasant by retaining the heat produced by the chimneys.\n\n#### Snow is the Nenets’ primary source of water.\n\n![](image\u002F133)\n\nThe Nenet women go outside the Chum with a small sled and a shovel whenever they need water. They collect clean snow which, on their return, is thrown into a saucepan over the fire on their return until it melts and — once cools — can be used as drinking water.\n\n#### Nature is the Nenets’ toilet.\n\nThe Chums have only one very small open space, therefore there is no room for a separate toilet. If they have to relieve themselves, they go outside and walk a long way (until they are sure that no one can see them from the camp) and do so in the snow. Men must walk to one side of the camp and women to the opposite. As reindeer are attracted by the smell of urine — even from long distances — this activity can prove quite the adventure!\n\n#### The Nenets have no weekend.\n\nTaking care of the reindeer and making sure they have the food they need is a job that needs attention seven days a week. Nenets only rest from work once a year: at a festive celebration where families within the community get together to compete in sled races and participate in traditional activities such as reindeer herding and other events from their culture.\n\n#### Nenets are affected by climate change.\n\nThe Nenets’ environment is one of the most severely impacted by climate change, as in the Arctic, the permafrost thaws faster and faster in the spring, meaning that each year it takes longer to freeze again in the fall. For this reason, herders have to modify their migration routes in search of snow, which is where the reindeer find their main sources of food.\n\n#### Reindeers find their food under the snow.\n\n![](image\u002F246)\n\nReindeer mainly feed on lichens that grow under the thick layer of snow. Their acute sense of smell allows them to track their food, digging holes with their snouts until they find it. In Nenet language these little holes, or pits, are called "kiekerö" and when the reindeer migrate to another place of pasture, to see thousands of them left on the snow plains is quite a sight.\n\n#### The Nenets spend long periods in total darkness.\n\n"Kaamos" is the period of time from November to January where, in the northernmost areas, the sun does not rise at all, making it a difficult time for the survival of both people and animals. The snow layers are thicker, meaning it is harder for reindeer to forage for food, and although today the Nenets use flashlights, it’s not hard to imagine just how much of a challenge this has posed over the past centuries.\n\n#### The only way into a camp is by sled.\n\n![](image\u002F248)\n\nNenets migrate from time to time, an activity which can take anything from a few days to an entire month depending on the food sources available to the reindeer. As soon as the lichen runs out, they have to change their area and to do so they cross their camps. For this reason, Nenet settlements are usually located where access is practically impossible. With no roads and a landscape covered in snow, the sled is the only viable means of transport, and the journey in can take anything from a few hours to several days.\n\n#### The Nenets have a great sense of humor.\n\nNenet people spend most of the year isolated from any other type of civilization, instead living in their small social nuclei. In these periods, many hours of the day are spent inside the Chum, talking and sharing stories while they warm up, eat, and rest from their exhausting daily work. It is wonderful to witness these intimate moments in which the Nenets play pranks on each other and laugh out loud about the unexpected and often peculiar adventures of the day.\n\n#### Nenets eat up to six times a day.\n\nLiving in such extreme temperatures and doing such hard, physical work causes the body to burn more calories than under normal circumstances, meaning that the Nenets have to stop working with the reindeer multiple times during the day to return to the Chum and recharge their energy. Their diet ranges from frozen fish — eaten raw — to reindeer meat, which is either eaten raw or boiled with rice and other staples bought from nearby towns on rare occasions in which they enter civilization. When they stray so far from their settlements that it is impossible to return home to refuel, the Nenets sacrifice a reindeer and eat it raw in order to continue working.\n\n#### The Nenet language is in danger of disappearing.\n\nToday, Nenents are required by Russian law to go to school, where the curriculum is taught entirely in Russian and there are very few lessons on the history and culture of the Nenets. This means that in order to learn the Nenet language, the family is the only resource. This means that Nenet children get used to speaking Russian before their own dialect and only the older generations continue to use it daily. For this reason, although the language is still used, it’s not difficult to see how it’s gradually being lost and might eventually disappear forever.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\nPlan your trip checking out the Nenets in our Tribes section.\n\n\u003Csup\u003EPhoto credits \u002F Javier Salinas\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E',

                title: "8 Things You Need to Know Before Visiting the Maasai",
                text: "Spread across Kenya and Tanzania, the Maasai community is arguably the most famous and well-known tribe in East Africa. They have traditionally lived as semi-nomadic pastoralists around the Masai Mara and Serengeti National Parks on both sides of the border. For decades, foreigners have visited Maasai villages as part of safari packages and the tribe has perhaps one of the longest running relationships with the tourism industry.\n\nThis relationship has been beneficial for the Maasai, but also contributed to many challenges, as whilst tourism can provide a sustainable alternative livelihood for villages, it can equally be damaging if not carried out in a culturally appropriate way.\n\nBefore you decide to head to Kenya or Tanzania and visit a Maasai community, there are a few things to consider and bear in mind as you embark upon your adventure. Here are eight things you need to know.\n\n#### Avoid stereotypes and leave your misconceptions at home\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions surrounding the Maasai, and it’s easy to revert to stereotypes. We have all seen photos of the women wearing colourful beads around their necks and the tall, slim men jumping metres into the air. However, there is much more to the Maasai culture than the aspects made famous by tourism posters and National Geographic covers.\n\nThe best thing you can do when visiting the Maasai, or any other tribal community in East Africa, is keep an open mind. We shouldn’t be bound by stereotypes that we have seen in the media, especially in tourist publications, which often reduces the Maasai culture to a few recognisable features (such as beaded jewellery and athleticism) when in fact there is so much more to the complex traditions and history of the tribe.\n\nBe willing to learn new things. You might find that some of your misconceptions are challenged or even changed as a result of the experience.\n\n#### Why it is important to travel with an ethical and responsible tour operator\n\nThe most difficult decision when visiting a traditional tribe is picking an ethical and responsible travel company. Tourism is not a new concept for the Maasai community - in fact, they have been open to tourism for many decades thanks to their close proximity to the Maasai Mara and Serengeti National Park: the continent’s big safari game parks.\n\nFor a long time, Maasai communities have seen the benefit of allowing visitors into their villages as a way to diversify their livelihoods beyond pastoralism and subsistence. Tourism represents a huge boost in income and opportunities for many remote communities, however some travel companies have gone on to exploit the Maasai for their own commercial gain: sometimes the money is not given back fairly to the community and often specific demands are placed on the villages in order to please tourists.\n\nYou should always ask the company you choose to travel with about their sustainable practice, and the policies and projects they have put in place to protect the heritage of the community to ensure that tourism is mutually beneficial for everyone involved.\n\n#### Be aware of ‘display’ or fake villages\n\nOne major impact of tourism in the Maasai areas around safari national parks has been the setting up of fake villages: villages built for show. Many safari packages take tourists to such places, where additional money is required to enter and exploits the tourists themselves as well as the Maasai people, who are in turn forced to portray a certain stylised show for visitors.\n\nBy visiting the Maasai tribes using a responsible travel company you will not only have a more genuine experience at a legitimate village, but be sure that the community itself will also benefit from a more authentic connection with the tourists.\n\n![](image\u002F128)\n\n#### Respect the Maasai traditions\n\nThe Maasai are a very proud and traditional tribe that have maintained many of their ceremonies and ways of life for generations. This is perhaps the main appeal for us as outsiders to visit their communities and learn about the relationship they have cultivated and nurtured with the land in which they live, however it also means we need to be respectful of their practices not dismiss something as ‘wrong’ just because it is not something we would do in our own lives.\n\nFor example, the Maasai are traditionally warriors — morans — and, in many of the remote communities, boys are still sent away for training to become a moran. This training involves hunting and surviving in the bush for weeks at a time, something we might consider cruel but is in fact an essential part of their tribal identity. It’s important we acknowledge and respect these different cultural practices and traditions.\n\n#### Show an interest in their culture\n\nOne of the other key reasons people are interested in visiting the Maasai is to learn about the proud traditions of this fascinating tribe. Rather than simply using your short visit to take a few photographs, be curious and use your time proactively by asking respectful questions.\n\nThe Maasai are very proud people and appreciate the chance to share their culture with foreigners. Take the time to ask them about how they live and perhaps think of questions that show you can relate to them. After all, travel is all about the cross-cultural connections and the sharing of knowledge and stories between people.\n\n#### Ask before taking photos or videos\n\nTaking a photograph to capture a memory is often an instinctive reaction when travelling. Although lots of of the Maasai communities are well accustomed to this, with many villages having a long-standing relationship with the tourism industry, you should still always ask permission before taking photos or shooting video footage: imagine if someone entered into your town and began taking photographs of your home, family and way of life without asking.\n\nIt’s particularly important to ask the permission of parents before taking photographs of children, however as a general rule you should ask before taking anybody’s photograph.\n\nThe Maasai are generally very friendly and most will be happy to oblige, especially if they’re dressed in traditional clothing, as this is an enormous source of pride for them. However, you should remember that older members of the community may not appreciate this, and it’s important to respect any villager’s decision to decline a photograph.\n\nYou should also be aware that for the Maasai people their livestock is the backbone of their livelihoods and that traditionally, rearing cattle has been how they have survived. As a result, a family’s livestock is very sacred to them and taking a photograph of their animals can be seen as disrespectful or threatening, so always ask before lifting your camera.\n\n#### Don’t offer money or gifts\n\nOne of the major concerns raised by the introduction of tourism into remote communities is the perception that foreigners are simply visiting for charity purposes. As we’ve mentioned, tourism can be a major force for a more sustainable and diversified livelihood for many communities, however the act of handing out money or gifts, although well-intentioned, can actually do more harm than good.\n\nOne of the most valuable things about travelling is the ability to interact and exchange stories and knowledge across different cultures, and this can be lost when tourists take the opportunity to hand out sweets or money. Although you may feel compelled to give something, especially to children, this can promote begging and confirm the notion that foreigners are there for this sole purpose of charity.\n\nThe best way you can give back to the communities that you visit is simply by being there and making sure that the travel company you choose to go with is doing the right thing in supporting the livelihood of the community. You can also help in other ways, such as purchasing local handmade goods which may support a family as well as the local economy.\n\n#### Be prepared for an adventure\n\nMany of the Maasai communities live in harsh, arid landscapes that are often quite far from large urban settlements, and you may notice that the villages don’t have access to many of the basic needs and privileges you take for granted. It’s okay to be a little confronted by what you see, however it’s important to do your research in advance so you are prepared for the adventure you’re signing up for.\n\nThere might be certain things that you can’t fully prepare for, but it’s important to try where you can, and to be as adventurous as possible when you’re there. For example, one of the staples of the traditional Maasai diet is the blood and milk of a cow. As semi-nomadic pastoralists, this is how they have survived in harsh landscapes and it is often still an important part of their culture, especially when animals are slaughtered ceremoniously.\n\nThis is likely to be troubling, even distressing for some outsiders, but by being as open minded and respectful as possible it will put both yourself and them at ease. It might mean stepping out of your comfort zone, but that’s often what travelling is all about.\n\n**ELISA DONKIN**\n\n**\u003Csup\u003EElisha Donkin\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E**\u003Csup\u003E is an Australian freelance writer and photographer, having written for Lonely Planet, Remote Lands, Matador Network and Travel Play Live magazine.

                title: "Ultimate Guide for Traveling Sustainably to Indigenous Communities",
                text: "Traveling teaches us to appreciate the world and its wonderful variety, but it can also be very polluting. We all must reduce our footprint and take better care of the planet to ensure that we do not cause irreparable damage to the only home we have.\n\nFurthermore, visiting an indigenous community means an additional risk to their environment, and therefore we must avoid at all costs endangering it to ensure the survival of the tribes.\n\nThe next time you plan a trip, we suggest you put our tips for more sustainable travel into practice.\n\n#### A. Reduce your Waste and Recycle\n\n1. Make sure you have the lowest impact on villages, most of them are not equipped with an efficient waste management system. Whatever waste you bring to the village, like plastic bottles or candy wrappers, these often end up in fields, rivers, beaches and in the ocean. Make sure to bring back with you all your waste and dispose it where you are sure it will be recycled. Unfortunately, this option is often missing in some countries. If you bring a trash bag with you, consider participating to at least a partial cleanup of a beach, a forest or any other natural environment\n2. Bring your own bags, containers and reusable utensils, especially if eating on the go! Plastic bags are common in local markets and often ditched in rivers or buried under the ground creating all sorts of health problems for the communities and they are toxic for the planet. Consider taking a reusable shopping bag with you when you go shopping in local markets, and since plastics utensils and containers are the norm, consider reusable utensils sets in bamboo (very lightweight) and containers. This will dramatically reduce your petroleum-based carbon footprint.\n3. When you have the option, search for locally purified water in recyclable glass bottles. Sometimes, especially in the tropics, green coconuts are a great option to stay hydrated! It is low in calories, naturally free of fat and cholesterol, contains more potassium than four bananas, and it is extremely hydrating. It also contains easily digested carbohydrates in the form of sugar and electrolytes.\n4. Dispose of all types of sanitary waste properly.\n\n![](image\u002F91)\n\n#### B. Conserve Water and limit Energy use\n\n1. The water you will have access to is a luxury for some of the tribes that you will visit, so make sure you don’t waste any. It is an extremely precious good and the communities will kindly share it with you! Energy is also uncommon in some areas, but when you have access to it, please make sure you limit your use of it! You can now travel using your own power or non-polluting power sources like solar powered cell phone battery recharger.\n\n#### C. Support Local Economies and Shop Carefully\n\n1. Invest in handmade goods: support the real local economy. What a better way to bring back with you a truly valuable reminder of your experience? Today, indigenous resistance to economic globalization and capitalism is essential for their survival so invest in some of the handmade local goods! This will help them, especially women which are often the handcrafters, to build a local economy and it will help families. This will also show them how much you appreciate their culture!\n2. If you come across markets selling wildlife or wildlife products, be conscious that these are often endangered species that have been captured in the wild and sold illegally. Seashells are now considered endangered and don’t be tempted to buy fur or leather. Travelers are considered to be inadvertently supporters of a growing marketplace for trafficking rare and endangered wildlife products as souvenirs. If you see it in a market it does not mean it is legal to buy it and these are often illegal to export or import. You will encounter serious fine at customs and be part of the trafficked at-risk species market, which is also dangerous for the global health according to the World Health Organization.\n\n**This is a list of the items to avoid and to watch out for:**\n\n“Antique” carved ivory tusk, coral jewellery, snake wine or reptile goods in general, tortoiseshell accessories, shells and coral jewelry, objects or medicine made from protected plants, fur from tigers, most spotted cats, seals, polar bears, and sea otters, live monkeys or apes, most live birds, including parrots, macaws, cockatoos, and finches, wild bird feathers and mounted birds, some live snakes, turtles, crocodilians, and lizards, certain leather products, including some made from caiman, crocodiles, lizards and snakes, some orchids, cacti, and cycads medicinals made from rhino, tiger, or Asiatic black bear. THESE ARE DANGEROUS FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nIf you want to do business with local companies or people engaged with the communities you will be visiting, please consider approaching sustainable businesses or association working toward the Sustainable Development Goals. Consider also donating to local foundations!\n\n#### D. How to respect the local Wildlife\n\n1. Do your research about the endangered species in the area you are travelling to and the overall condition of the flora and fauna.\n2. While hiking, stick to the path, going off the beaten path could mean you could step on protected or endangered plants. Do not feed wildlife, don't taunt them and keep a safe distance. Often times, doctors and hospitals can be hours away, so stay alert and be aware of your surroundings! Do not try to take wild animals home with you.\n3. Do NOT encourage local people to keep wild animals as pets and pay to have your picture taken with them. This is often an incentive to poach endangered species from the wild and obtain pets to display for tourists. Owners often lie about the true situation or aren’t aware. Reconsider riding elephants, drinking civet coffee, swimming with endangered animals and be aware of safaris. Try to visit a sanctuary or wildlife preserve area where animals are free in their natural habitat.\n4. Opt for sunscreen that are biodegradable and reef safe. This also applies to soaps and shampoos. The waste generated by your use of these products will soak in the soil, that we will be later drank by the local communities digging for water, or will end up in rivers, streams or in the ocean endangering their fragile ecosystems. Chemical ingredients in soaps and sunscreens are now banned from some countries since they jeopardize the fragile ecosystem of the reefs, its marine life or the soil. Make sure your sunscreen is reef safe and it does not contain oxybenzone and octinoxate which bleach corals, and your soaps are biodegradable.\n5. Make sure you are not packing with you involuntarily seeds, insect egg, and other living material that can also hide in your shoes. You may carry these plants to new locations unintentionally, and end up bringing invasive species to protected areas.\n\n#### E. How to lower your carbon footprint\n\n1. Opt for public transportation and sharing services, it will also add to your travels an incredible experience and you will interact with local people! Bikes rentals are often common and a great way to visit sites.\n2. If you are afraid of your carbon footprint while flying, try to choose a fuel efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus 345. The Boeing 787 aircraft will be soon the best option, its fuel consumption will be 27 percent less than other similarly sized aircraft.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**\n\n\u003Csup\u003ECover photo iStock.com\u002FAzmanJaka\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E",

                title: "10 Fundamental Tips for Visiting Indigenous Tribes",
                text: 'As the popularity of indigenous tourism and the desire to learn about the “true” way of life of the natives increases throughout the world, we have to be more aware of how to make a positive impact on the communities we visit.\n\nLiving with an indigenous tribe can be among the most life-changing experiences a traveler can have but you must avoid at all costs that your contact with the host communities supposes the vanishing of the authenticity that you seek so much.\n\nFor this reason and to maintain the beautiful heritage that all indigenous peoples have left us throughout history, you have to follow some fundamental tips to preserve their lifestyle.\n\n#### Respect, Learn and Accept: Tolerance!\n\nTolerance is at the base of universal human rights and respect of diversity, especially in the sharing of cultures!\n\nLive by the "golden rule": “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”.\n\nCultural differences are the mix of race, ethnicity, gender, class, physical and mental abilities, religion and spiritual beliefs, age, and more. We must learn the ability to learn from the communities and treat people respectfully accepting their backgrounds. Remember to resist the urge to judge views that differ from yours and consider them wrong. Avoid imposing your own values, culture and stereotyping!\n\n#### Don’t push your limits, do your research and be prepared to face reality\n\nIf you feel like some of the tribes might be too extreme, don’t push your limits! Some of our communities live in very harsh climates and locations, this could be a problem for you and it is perfectly fine not feeling too sure or at ease. Do your research before booking your experience and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.\n\nBe ready to experience their reality with an open mind. Remember the cultural differences you might have, and don’t forget that some of them didn’t have access to some of the privileges you have been granted!\n\nAfribadger is working to protect its communities and to bring basic needs to all of them. If you want to know more about the actions we are taking to support the people we work with, stay up-to-date with the news in our Discovery section, and also follow us on our social media.\n\n#### Respect the Wildlife and be a responsible guest.\n\nWhen travelling to remote areas, it is easy to forget that some communities don’t have access to a proper waste management system. Whatever waste you bring to the village, like plastic bottles or candy wrappers, these often end up in fields, rivers, beaches and in the ocean. Make sure to bring back with you all your waste and dispose it where you are sure it will be recycled.\n\nChemical ingredients in soaps and sunscreens are now banned from some countries since they jeopardize the fragile ecosystem of the reefs, marine life or the soil. Make sure your sunscreen is reef safe and it does not contain oxybenzone and octinoxate which bleach corals, and your soaps are biodegradable.\n\nIf you’re hiking in the wilderness don’t leave any trace of you behind, vandalize anything (buildings, rocks, trees, etc), or remove objects from their natural environment. Conserve water, limit energy use and dispose of sanitary waste properly!\n\nFor more tips on how to travel sustainable and how you can minimize your impact on the local flora and fauna, make sure to check our guide: “Ultimate Guide to Travel Sustainably to Indigenous Communities”\n\n#### Smile, learn basic words and communicate with hands\n\nSmiling is an international language! If you have the chance, learn some expressions and words in the local language, they will definitely appreciate the effort and it will show them not only how much you respect their culture but also how much you value their intangible culture. Unfortunately, tribal languages are more and more endangered and oftentimes, elderly members of the communities don’t see the point to teach them to new generations. When in need, speak with your hands or try facial expressions.\n\n#### Enjoy and be respectful with the traditional food!\n\nAs you can imagine, tribal food can be very different from what you are used to! When invited, you should try the food members of the community prepare for you, especially to avoid offending them! If you have dietary preferences, always make sure to tell them explain the reasons and refuse politely.\n\n#### Help out!\n\nWe know that our Nomadi are diligent travelers, and we know you are on holiday, however, to live a true experience with our communities, make sure to get involved in the daily life and help out your host community! Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty and to show your skills, all while helping the tribes to build village’s huts or cook!\n\n#### Ask permission before taking a photo and be ready to show your pictures\n\nConsider this, how would you respond if someone was taking a picture without your permission?\n\nIf you want to take a picture that will last you forever of the communities you will visit, remember to always ask permission, and if you want to take a picture of a young child always ask their parents. It is easy for people to feel exploited and disrespected, especially if we don’t value their privacy, the members of the community will surely appreciate your politeness!\n\nPeople love to see the pictures that talented travelers take of them, they are often extremely curious, so be ready to show all your photos!\n\nFurthermore, you should avoid taking pictures of members that ask you for money in exchange. Unfortunately, oftentimes this might be perceived as a better income resulting in people not taking care of the cattle or other daily tasks anymore.\n\n#### Do not bring gifts and avoid giving money\n\nIt is hard to imagine that some children don’t have access to basic education, pencils or toys, but unfortunately this is the reality in many of our communities.\n\nAfribadger is currently working on different cultural and social projects to bring basic needs to all tribes involved. Make sure to visit our foundation page in the near future where you can donate, help our cause and learn more about our future projects.\n\nMany travelers usually feel like bringing sweets, clothes, books, and pencils to give to the children. However, this can do more harm than good since it can bring up community conflict and stimulate dependency and begging.\n\nIf you feel like giving, it is better to invest in a reputable local organizations that is already engaged in social development programs for the tribe.\n\nAvoid giving any kind of medicines, it could be harmful for some members since they might be allergic to them without knowing it and it could jeopardize the power and position of local tribal healers\n\n#### Invest in handmade goods: support the real local economy.\n\n![](image\u002F89)\n\nWhat a better way to bring back with you a truly valuable reminder of your experience? Today, indigenous resistance to economic globalization and capitalism is essential for their survival so invest in some of the handmade local goods! This will help them, especially women which are often the handcrafters, to build a local economy and it will help families. This will also show them how much you appreciate their culture! In general, never buy wildlife products!\n\n#### Explore, don’t linger!\n\nYou are going to see some of the most beautiful landscapes in which wildlife is still quite untouched, make sure to take it all in and bring it back home with you! Have lots of fun, all while learning about diversity and cultural differences.\n\n**Afribadger TEAM**',

And those places that I had previously seen unreachable begin to see them closer, more feasible, more likely and the world is getting smaller.\n\nIf you are addicted to traveling, or you make parts of the "Knowmads, the workers of the future" … You will probably feel identified with these signals (written by 50 travelers from my Facebook).\n\nAnd if not, it\'s time for you to join this addiction:\n\nThe tripadictos feel that they can travel the whole world without stopping.

                title: "13 Ways To Help The Himba People And Culture In Namibia",
                text: "Protecting the Himba people of Namibia is a must. \n\nWe ought to work out ways to preserve the Himba culture and helping it thrive again. \n\nTraveling abroad to meet different cultures is definitely one of the main aspects of international tourism. However, before including the visit to isolated tribes such as the Himba people to your itinerary, it’s important to ask yourselves how you can travel responsibly to meet them without jeopardizing their habits, traditions and cultural heritage in general.\n\nAnother thing that - as responsible travelers - you need to think about before traveling to distant lands to meet tribes is whether your visit can bring benefit to the local population. You should only embark on the trip if so.\n\nMake sure to read my post. In this post, I will suggest the best ways in which responsible travel can help protect the Himba people in Namibia. Before doing so, let me tell you how my group and I went about approaching the Himba people, and give you some background information the Himba culture.\n\nNamibia culture is a surprising mix of tribes and ethnicities, counting about a dozen ethnic groups. The most well-known tribes to international travelers are the Himba ones, probably because of their very interesting appearance and customs\n\nThe Himba people live in the north-western part of Namibia. Many of them still live a traditional semi-nomadic lifestyle, sharing their very simple villages with their goats which are the main source of food and wealth in general.\n\nWhile Himba men spend most of their time outside of the villages looking after the cattle, Himba women are the ones in charge for the village, where they cook, clean up and look after their many kids. \n\nHimba women go topless, only wearing handmade, traditional jewelry and a pretty simple leather skirt. Other distinctive features are their hair, braided and covered in red mud and butter, as well as their skin, covered in a paste made of ochre, butter and spices.\n \nThe Himba people are semi-nomadic and they move according to the rain. Whenever there are heavy rains, they will follow them. But heavy rains haven’t come in a long time and people as well as their animals are suffering. Tourists however can visit Namibia in any season. This means they can help - it is just a matter of picking the right way to travel.\n\nHimba people hardly have access to healthcare and they wish to receive medicines. This is a sensitive topic, because most of them can’t read and it wouldn’t be responsible to just leave medicines in the village: children could easily access it, and nobody would really know what they are for, making it very risky.\n\nApproaching The Himba People Of Namibia. There are many ways to visit a place and the idea is to pick the most responsible one, the one that supports the local community and doesn’t bring any damage.\n\nI visited Namibia with Afribadger, who handpicked a local operator working in a way that supports the local population in many different ways. During this trip I had the chance to meet Himba people in different locations, before stopping and camping at a Himba village for a few days to really get involved in the village life.\n\nDuring the 5-days-long journey all the way up to the border with Angola - where our small group of researchers was going to stop for the Himba village experience - we mainly stayed in the wild thanks to a local backup team, following a strict “zero-impact camping style, not leaving anything behind.\n\nFor 2 nights we stayed in a self-catering, simple yet lovely lodge run by locals within the Orupembe conservancy, called Etaambura Camp. \n\nNot far from this lodge is a Himba village, so we invited the Himba chief of the area and his sister for dinner to ask them directly about their views on tourism. I can’t think of a better way to get right, unbiased answers!\n\nThe Chief’s name was Uapenga and his sister’s one was Uatambauka. We sat together at the table of our lodge and after introducing each other we started asking questions. With the help of our backup team we were able to translate and understand each other.\n\nWe were told that some tourists help and some others don’t, and that it’s important to promote responsible tourism: community campsites provide support for the Himba people, especially in the last few years with severe droughts. \n\nWhen we stayed at the Himba village we were told that only 1 person before us actually stayed there with the Himbas in history, and it was a National Geographic reporter. This doesn’t mean that the Himba people never see visitors, but sadly it means that most tourists are not truly interested in spending time with them.\n\nWe were told that most of the time all visitors do is take photos and some of them even avoid physical contact with the Himbas, which they find offensive.\n\nDuring my trip to Namibia with Afribadger we aimed to meet the Himba people and get to know them as much as possible, spending some time with them and not just passing by to snap some photos - a shameful behavior also known as “human safari” - as most tours do.\n \nWith the help of the local operator we achieved our goal in a way that not only didn’t bring damage to the Himba people, but also positively impacted their protection and culture\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, thanks to the right choices made in the preparation process.\n\n\n14 Ways In Which Tourists Can Help The Himba People Of Namibia.\n\nPeople are different, not better or worse. Responsible tourism doesn’t have the presumption of “helping.” The goal is to positively impact the protection of the local culture and environment.\n\nIf you really want to make sure you have a positive impact on the Himba people of Namibia as a traveler, there are a few things you can and should do. The following is a summary.\n\nFirst of all, make sure to pick an ethical, local operator, and even before starting the trip sit together, explain what you are expecting from your trip, and decide how to do it with the guide’s suggestions.\n\nPick campsites or lodges that give back to the community. \nThe money paid by each guest at Etaambura Camp - more than 6.000 Euros in 2018 alone - goes to the local conservancy which is run by locals who spend the money within the conservancy. Also, the Orupembe conservancy is owned by Himbas. In other words: make sure to stay in places that give back to the community.\n\nApproach your final destination slowly. \nMake sure to approach your final destination slowly, getting to know the territory first, its geography, understanding its history and gathering all the information you need about the local tribes thanks to your guide before actually meeting them.\n\nThink about landing in Namibia without knowing anything about the country and its tribes, and going straight to a Himba village for the night. Wouldn’t it be awkward, rough and too intense for both you and the Himbas? Would you even know what to say and how to act?\n\nThe golden rule for gifting is to stick to things that are familiar to and needed by the Himba people. The village we visited was in need for durable pottery - some women were cooking in tin cans! - and containers in general, preferably not plastic ones for obvious reasons.\n\nOther things that the Himba people will appreciate are covers and fabric in general, against the cold desert nights.\n \nAs for food, the best things to take to a Himba village are maize flour, rice and clean water.\n\nBuying local products helps local families, avoids unnecessary heavy luggage (hence extra C02 emissions) and makes sure that you find exactly what the Himbas would buy: familiar food. In case you’re wondering what exactly to buy, be reassured that a knowledgeable guide knows what is best to bring and what is needed at a specific time. You will also need the guide to help you with the shopping for translation purposes.\n\nLivestock is the main source of livelihood for the Himba people. You may think that it’s easy to have food when you have a flock of goats, but this is far from the truth. Animals must be fed, watered and taken care of, plus killing a goat a day would leave the Himba villages without any food source - not even milk - and this would lead to starvation. Ask your guide for guidance in buying a goat from a farmer nearby the Himba village. This will be an appreciated gift which will became the dinner for the whole village. \n\nLearn some Himba words.\nGoing back to the language topic, I suggest you to learn some of the language before arriving to the Himba village - your guide will surely be happy to help you with that. What a huge pleasure it will be to make some conversation, although very simple, with the Himba people in their own language. They will be surprised and happy about it.\n\nBond with the people.\nA responsible way to visit the Himba tribe or any tribe in the world should include some sort of bonding with the people, and most of all a lot of respect. Get close to them. Don't be afraid of touching the children, of holding them!\n\nNamibia is a wonderful country which is becoming more and more popular within the traveling community. In order to avoid the exploitation of certain areas make sure to go off the beaten path, where you will meet virtually zero other travelers. Not only this is pleasant as you will have the whole place to yourselves daily, but also with your “zero-waste” camping you know you will not be bringing unnecessary damage to the environment.\n\nAs I have said before, the Himba needs medicines but many of them can't read. Make sure to leave yours to the manager of the lodge who knows the Chief personally and can read and bring medicines to the nearby villages only when needed. Also, make sure to recommend the manager to help the Himba people reaching the clinics if needed, as pills alone are not a solution.\n\nIf you want to leave something to the Himba village please don’t let it be money. The Himba people have no currency and money doesn’t belong to their traditions. It is risky to give money because it may be used it in turn to buy things that don’t belong to their traditions either.\n\nAlthough it looks like a harmless and kind gesture please consider not bringing candies to the Himba children. They don’t need unnecessary sugar (like all of us!) so why bringing something so addictive to their lives?\n \nTry to avoid plastic wrapping as much as possible. There are no trash cans in Himba villages and all waste ends up directly into the environment - or burnt, which is not a good idea with plastic!\n\nHimbas are generally happy to be photographed, but it’s always good to ask permission before taking photos. This definitely falls under the “respect” category.\n\nFinal tips on positively impacting the Himba of Namibia.\nTo sum up, don’t force your vision, don’t “teach.” Travel is all about learning. You have the chance of learning from one of the most interesting tribes in the world. Listen to their stories, observe their habits. You may be one of the last lucky people to witness such a way of life so embrace it. \n\nWhy? Because global warming may not affect our western life much, but it’s making a huge difference for people like the Himbas who depend on rains to live. The effect of our actions is reflected here. \n\nBe responsible, always.\n\n\nThis post has been written by Giulia Cimarosti, an incredible photographer and travel writer who agreed to cover for me during Afribadger trip to Namibia. I wish to thank her for her incredible work and for all her insights.\n\nDisclaimer: Giulia was a guest of the Afribadger during her trip to Namibia and was thrilled to be one of the first to test this itinerary. Needless to say, the views expressed in this post remain hers.\n\nvia @clautavani\nhttps:\u002F\u002Fmyadventuresacrosstheworld.com\n\nPhotos Copyright: Giulia Cimarosti",

                title: "Everything You Should Know Before Visiting A Berber Village In Morocco",
                text: "Visiting a Berber village in Morocco is a must and whether you just go for a short time or, like I did, spend 5 full days hiking through the Atlas Mountains, you're bound to have an incredible time.\n\nThe good news is going to the Atlas Mountains to visit the Berber tribes in Morocco is very easy. Amizmiz, one of the largest towns at the base of the Atlas, is just one hour drive and from there you can quickly get to the smaller villages.\n\nHowever, there are some few important things you should know about the Berber culture before you visit.\n\nIn this post, I will explain everything you need to know before visiting a Berber village in Morocco and share a few tips so that you can make the most of your time during your visit.\n\n13 Things To Know Before Visiting A Berber Village In Morocco\n\nThe actual name of Berbers is Amazigh. \n\nThe official name of Berber tribes in Morocco is actually a word which means \"free people.\" \n\nThe name Berber derives from the word \"Barbarian\" and in general the Amazigh don't like to be referred to as Berbers. In reality, the word Barbarian derives from the Greek \"barbaroi\" or the Latin \"Barbari\" and in the common use during the time of the Roman Empire it meant \"foreigner\" and was used to refer to anybody who was not from Rome, and not intended in an insulting way. The Arabs used it to refer to people who spoke a language other than Arabic. Please note I am only using the word \"Berber\" for purely simplicity reasons, and that I do not attach to it any negative connotation.\n\nThey are more than 15 millions in Morocco.\n\nThe Amazigh are scattered across Northern Africa, where they are more than 50 million, and around 15 million of them live in Morocco. \n\nThough most Amazigh also speak Arabic, in reality their language is Tamazigh, of which there are several dialects and varieties. \n\nThe language was officially recognized with the new Moroccan Constitution in 2011, but to date no law that implements the changes and that pushes for the use of Amazigh in public life and education has been passed. On occasions, some people who have spent time in France they speak French - but in general you will need an interpreter and a local guide to be able to communicate with the Amazigh.\n\nThey live a very traditional life.\n\nThe Amazigh main source of income is agriculture and cattle farming. Most men are shepherd and move around with their animals in search of pastures. At times they are gone for days and even weeks with their animals. Women usually look after the children and the house.\n\nBoth men and women wear traditional clothes and they are Sunni muslim.\n\nThough most Amazigh live in very modest clay houses with little comforts, with time some have managed to build bigger homes with modern touches. Electricity made it to this part of Morocco no more than 10 years ago, and running water at times is not a thing.\n\nA typical house consists of a kitchen and several rooms which are often scattered around an internal patio - one of them is a living room, with lots of stools and couches: this is where guests are welcomed. The bathroom is usually very modest and consist of a squat toilet and a sink (at times there's not even that). The most comfortable houses have a hammam, which is what the Amazigh use to traditionally wash themselves.\n\nThey eat with their hands.\n\nOne of the best parts of visiting a Berber village in Morocco is trying local food and eating with local families. The Amazigh don't use cutlery and dishes for their food, but typically eat out of the clay pot used to prepare the food - the tajine - scooping up the food with bread. When eating couscous they use a spoon.\n\nThey don't drink alcohol.\n\nSince the Amazigh are Muslims, they don't drink alcohol so don't expect to see any wine, beer or liquor during your visit - whether for a day or longer. \n\nBut tea is poured at any time of day.\n\nThe one thing that is constantly pouring in Berber villages in Morocco is tea. It's not even remotely close in taste to what you may be accustomed to, and it is serious business here - the procedure to prepare a proper pot of tea is quite elaborate and the end result absolutely delicious. You will be able to try the typical mint tea or an even more fragrant tea with herbs.\n\nThe Amazigh love their tea with lots and lots of sugar, but if you - like me - aren't a fan of the sweet flavor, you can ask to pour yours before sugar is added.\n\nPeople are very welcoming.\n\nThe Amazigh people are incredibly friendly. Whether you visit one of the wealthiest family or one of the more modest ones, they will make it a point to welcome you with tea, snacks, and to show you around their house. On some occasions, they will even show your their best dresses and ask you to try them on, and then pose for photos with you.\n\nAmazigh children are absolutely adorable.\n\nAmazigh people have lots of children, and these are absolutely adorable and during a trip to the Berber villages in Morocco you'll have plenty of opportunities to interact with them. As soon as they realize there's a visitor in the village, they'll come running and make a show of their best tricks, engage you in a game of soccer, pull you by your hand to take you around the village and show you to their family and friends. They will be all smiles and hugs and will make your time even more memorable!\n\nThey are just as concerned as we are about climate change.\n\nThe Amazigh may live an isolated life in the remote villages of the Atlas Mountains, but they are not oblivious of the main issues the world is facing. On a conversation with a local shepherd in the village of Tizzga, it emerged that climate change is a major cause of concern, with people worried that with desertification and heat they won't have pasture for their animals and they will lose their means of livelihood.\n\nTo the Amazigh, mules are a means of transportation.\n\nMules are working animals to the Amazigh and when you'll visit you will notice that a lot of them are charged with weights or that that people ride them. Please keep in mind that using mules for work purposes is part of the local culture, and that these animals are nicely treated and well taken care of - it's in the interest of their owners to make sure that the animals are healthy and fit to work.\n\nWaste disposal is very much an issue.\n\nAlthough it is doing much better than its neighboring countries, waste disposal is very much an issue in Morocco, and even more so in the Berber villages of the Atlas Mountains where there is no garbage collection system. You may not notice if you just visit for a day, but there are large waste dumps close to the villages and people often set them on fire, with terrible consequences for the environment and their health.\n\nMy hope is that policies to reduce plastic waste, as well as garbage collection and recycling policies are implemented as soon as possible.\n\nBerber villages in Morocco are actually very safe.\n\nWe often hear people express their worry that Morocco is not exactly safe and people who have visited say that they have been victims of scams. I can't comment for the cities - I didn't spend enough time in Marrakech. But I can tell you that the Berber villages of the Atlas Mountains are absolutely safe and the people nothing but nice.\n\nAs the Amazigh people of Morocco are usually Sunni Muslims, both Berber women and men are dressed very modestly, with women covering their head and men usually wearing a long sort of coat that goes all the way to their ankles.\n\nAlthough you won't be required to cover your head, it's definitely recommended to be dressed modestly regardless of the weather, covering your shoulders and chest, wearing long pants or a long skirt and avoiding anything that is too tight and revealing.\n\nGet an excellent guide.\n\nYou shouldn't be visiting a Berber village in Morocco independently. This is not for safety reason: the villages are truly lovely places and the people are kind and welcoming. But the language barrier is such that unless you get someone that speaks the local language you won't be able to make much of what you see and experience.\n\nImportantly, you need not only to have a guide, but to have an excellent one that proactively talks to the local communities, that is willing to act as an interpreter, and that has a real interest in informing you about the culture and customs of the Amazigh people.\n\nThis may seem like an obvious kind of tip, but I only too often seen guides that were not really interested in what they were meant to do, and this diminished the experience. Make sure to enquire locally for a recommended guide, or - should you decide to book your trip the the Berber villages in Morocco online - take your time to go through the reviews.\n\nAs soon as you get to the first Berber village, you will realize that there are many children, and that these are just as curious about you as you are about them. They will run after you, pull you by your hand so that you can go play with them, show you with pride to their friends and family. In some cases, they will ask you for small things - pens, candies, treats.\n\nIf you are thinking about bringing some presents for the children, enquire with your guide beforehand to get an idea of what may be some good options.\n\nIn general, I do not recommend bringing anything such as candies, chocolates or other kind of snacks - for two main reasons: most of the time these are wrapped in plastic, and the kids will just throw the wrap anywhere they happen to be, a lot of children in this part of the country have teeth issues (I have seen a good deal with major cavities).\n\nIf you don't have the opportunity to consult with your guide before visiting, consider bringing a book - something that they can read or that they can use to write and study. You can even donate books to the local school.\n\nBuy locally made souvenirs.\n\nYou won't find many shops when visiting a Berber village in Morocco. You will however come across places such as women cooperatives where you can see them brushing and preparing the wool and even making carpets. These are really inexpensive and truly local souvenirs and buying them will certainly bring a small contribution to the welfare of the local communities.\n\nMake sure to carry some spare change and enough cash in case you have an opportunity to shop!\n\nOne thing you will notice the minute you'll get into a Berber village in Morocco is how friendly people are - men, women and children will all smile at you, and you should do the same. It's the first means of communication and it's a nice way to break the language barrier.\n\nOn an occasion I even had a woman hugging me - it came completely unexpected, and it was such a genuine gesture that I was truly touched.\n\nIf you have time and want to have a more in depth experience of the Berber culture, you should consider joining a long distance hiking trip like the one I did.\n\nMy hike was organized by Afribadger, a new tour operator which strives to allow travelers to have real and at times raw experiences with indigenous communities around the world, and to do so in a manner that is responsible and completely supportive of local communities.\n\nDuring the hike, you'll be able to appreciate the gorgeous landscape of the Atlas Mountains and you will be visiting various villages, with a chance of encountering the Amazigh people, visiting their homes (and in fact, sleeping in their houses) and sharing a bit of their daily life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: I was a guest of the Afribadger during my trip to Morocco and I was thrilled to be one of the first to test this itinerary. Needless to say, the views expressed in this post remain my own.\n\nClaudia Tavani\nhttps:\u002F\u002Fmyadventuresacrosstheworld.com\u002F\nvia @clautavani",

                title: "30 Things To Consider Before Traveling To Patagonia",
                text: "Traveling to Patagonia is many a dream, including mine. To be fair, it is such a spectacular place that even after having been there 3 times already, I hardly feel like my dream came true and I feel compelled to visit and again. This easily qualifies as one of my favorite places on earth.\n\nPatagonia is huge, very diverse and simply breathtaking. But traveling around Patagonia is easier said than done: the weather is unpredictable; the infrastructure often lacking, and the prices higher than a backpacker would hope for.\n\nSure enough, before you plan to visit Patagonia you should do a bit of research so that you know what to expect. So, I have decided to put together a post that sums up a few facts and things you should know before you go there.\n\n30 Important Things To Know Before Traveling To Patagonia\n\nPatagonia is huge\n\nSaying that you are traveling to Patagonia hardly gives a clear indication of where you are going. Patagonia is huge! First of all, it spans across two countries – Argentina and Chile. Only in Argentina, it comprises a whopping 5 provinces: Chubut, Neuquén, Río Negro, Tierra del Fuego and Santa Cruz.\nI recommend visiting both countries, if you have the time (Patagonia calls for slow travel, actually) and your budget allows it. A good idea may be flying into Buenos Aires and out of Santiago de Chile, and then moving around by bus to cover the shorter distances and by plane for the longest ones.\n\nIt calls for slow travel\n\nThe best way to fully enjoy Patagonia is by taking your time to explore it, to take in all the amazing views and landscapes it has to offer. Try to be as spontaneous as possible, letting your travel plans unfold little by little, so that you can make the most of the good weather – should you be so lucky to have a few days of sun in a row. And make sure to give yourself plenty of time to move from one place to the other: with such huge distances bus rides take a lot of time and easily warn you out. Just to give you an example, the ride from El Chalten to Bariloche takes a whopping 24 hours!\n\nBut if you are short on time, planning is vital\n\nThis almost contradicts what I have said before about slow travel, I know. However, if you are short on time but still want to visit Patagonia, careful planning is vital. This means taking a few planes to connect you from one place to the other (which will inevitably increase the price of your trip), or joining a guided tour where you let the experts do the planning job and you just have to plan what goes in your backpack.\nIf you like the idea of sitting down while someone else organizes your Patagonia trip, and want to join a guided group tour, you may want to consider the following tours:\n\n•\tPatagonia Hiking: this is a fantastic tour, perfect for active travelers who want to be in nature for most of their time. It lasts 9 days with stops at a bunch of the most famous places in Patagonia.\n\n•\tArgentina Multisport: the perfect tour for very active travelers who like the idea of hiking, biking and even rafting.\n\n•\tHike Patagonia In Depth: the name says it all. This tour is for those who want to spenda s much time as possible hiking. You’ll be spending a few nights camping.\n\n•\tBest of Patagonia: a 13 days tour hitting all the landmarks of Patagonia.\n\n•\t6 Day tour of Patagonia: a short but sweet tour if you have limited time to travel to Patagonia.\n\n•\tPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego: the best tour if you also want to go to Tierra del Fuego and want to visit both the Argentinian and Chilean side of Patagonia.\n\nEspecially for certain places\n\nFor as much as you may want to be spontaneous and even if you have all the time in the world, there will be some places for which you will have to plan in advance during your Patagonia trip. Torres del Paine National Park is one of the highlights of Chilean Patagonia, but unless you have some accommodation booked (whether camping or staying in lodges) local authorities won’t let you get on trails such as the W-trek or the O-circuit (both multi-day hikes). In the high season, this means booking months in advance and it will often imply planning the rest of your trip around those dates.\n\nBorder crossing is easier said than done\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when traveling to Patagonia – especially if you want to visit both Chile and Argentina – is that border crossing in South America is not that straightforward. Even if you don’t need a visa, the process can be very slow. You will have to get to one border, line up to get your passport stamped out, move to the other border (which can be as far as 5 km) and get your passport stamped in.\nBorder control is actually quite strict, especially in Chile, and your bags will carefully screened to make sure you are not carrying anything that may hinder the local flora, fauna and agricultural crops. Make sure not to carry things such as fruit or meat or dairy products if you plan to cross the border. I was stuck for a good hour when I crossed to go to Torres del Paine, because a German guy traveling on the same bus forgot he had an apple and a banana in his bag – for which he had to pay a hefty fine.\n\nPatagonia is pristine\n\nOne thing you’ll immediately notice upon traveling to Patagonia is how clean it is. Not only the air is clear and crisp; but you won’t see any garbage aroundalong trails and in national parks, despite the fact that there are no garbage bins. Be respectful of the environment and always take a small bag to dispose of your garbage: make sure you contribute to the effort to keep Patagonia clean.\n\nYou should be environmentally conscious\n\nSpeaking of efforts to keep Patagonia clean, male sure to consider the impact of your actions and try to be an environmentally conscious traveler as much as possible. Always walk on the trails – you’ll often see signs that warn you that certain areas are recuperating. Never light fires in the forest. Fires started by careless hikers have caused incredible damage to Patagonia in the last decade (it was in 2012 that a massive portion of Torres del Paine burned down following a fire lit by a camper). Remember that the strong winds of Patagonia carry the fire far and fast!\n\nThe views are incredible throughout\n\nWhether driving along the vast planes of Chubut, the windy roads of Tierra del Fuego, or along the peaks of the province of Santa Cruz, you can rest assured of something: when traveling to Patagonia, you will no shortage of breathtaking views.\n\nThe wildlife is unique\n\nOne of the biggest treats when traveling to Patagonia is the possibility of admiring the local wildlife. Guanacos – a wild species similar to llamas and alpacas – are found throughout Patagonia, from the vast plains of Chubut to the icy Tierra del Fuego. Depending on the season, you’ll be able to seesouthern right whales, orcas and sea lions in Chubut, as well as in Tierra del Fuego. Various species of penguins live on the shores of Chubut (the best place to see them is Punta Tombo) and in Tierra del Fuego. Other animals that populate this part of the world are pumas (though they are way more difficult to spot), flamingos, foxes and an incredible variety of birds.\n\nThe weather is crazy  \n\nThe best time to visit Patagonia is the summer, between the end of November and the very beginning of April. Even if you may want to visit in the low season, you won’t have much of a choice: most businesses, hotels, restaurants, and tour companies and even bus routes only operate in the summer months. Trails are closed in the winter months, and often covered in snow anyways. You may be able to travel to Patagonia in the shoulder season, ie in October and in April and May, and enjoy it when it is less crowded. But before heading there make sure to double check if trails are accessible and if any hotel or hostel is still open.\nProvided that you are traveling to Patagonia in the summer, rest assured that you’ll get a good dose of the crazy Patagonian weather. On any given day, you may get sun, wind, rain and at times even snow. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend to be fully equipped for sudden weather changes.\n\nYou’ll be hiking most of the time (and should be prepared for it)\n\nMost people who travel to Patagonia go there to hike, and to be fair most of the incredible sites in Patagonia require a bit of an effort to get to admire them. Obviously, bus travel allows you to visit some of the most famous places such as Perito Moreno Glacier or Tierra del Fuego National Park, but for the vast majority, you need to hike.\n\nNeedless to say, you should be prepared for all the hiking you’ll be doing. This means being actually fit – don’t attempt to hike to Laguna de Los Tres is the most exercise you’ve done in the last few months was lifting your pint glass. And it also means being properly geared for the hikes.\n\nYou should build some rest days in your itinerary\n\nHiking (and traveling in general) can be exhausting. Make sure to allow yourself a rest day between the longest hikes, to give your legs and feet a break. You can use those rest days to do other useful things such as planning the next steps of your Patagonia trip, looking for bus companies for your onward travel; booking guided tours with local companies; doing laundry (such a hard thing to do if you keep moving from one place to the other!) and – quite simply – relaxing before you head on to the next hike.\n\nPatagonia is actually quite expensive\n\nThere is no other way to put it, really. If you are planning to travel to Patagonia, you should be aware of the fact that this is not a cheap place. Although access to the trails is free for the most part (you’ll be paying a fee to access Los Glaciares National Park, where Perito Moreno Glacier is located, and to visit Tierra del Fuego National Park), everything else will add up to the costs.\nAccommodation, food, transportation and – should you do any – tours in Patagonia are expensive. However, this should not prevent you from traveling to Patagonia. By all means, go. Just plan your trip smartly so that you can save a bit here and there.\n\nYou should pick your accommodation wisely\n\nThe best way to keep your costs down when traveling to Patagonia is by picking your accommodation wisely. The good news is that Patagonia offers a wide range of options for just about any taste and budget, with refugios(mountain huts); hotels; boutique hotels; chalets; hostels and even camping sites. Hostels, chalets and camping sites are obviously the best options if you have a small budget, especially because you have the possibility of cooking as well. However, keep in mind that Patagonia is becoming an increasingly popular destination and that places fill up quickly. Make sure to book in advance for a chance to get a spot in the cheapest places.\n\nIt can be crowded – but never overwhelming\n\nAs I have said before, Patagonia is becoming an increasingly popular holiday destination for nature and hiking lovers, and on a regular day you’ll find a lot of people on most trails. Yet, it’s such a vast place that you’ll hardly feel overwhelmed. Besides, most travelers visit Patagonia with only one thing in mind: hiking. This means you’ll likely encounter like minded people with whom to share your experiences and who you can join on the trails.\n\nInternet is hardly a thing\n\nMake sure to warn your family and friends before traveling to Patagonia, and to set an automatic out-of-office reply for your email. Internet is hardly a thing in many places around Patagonia. While in El Calafate you’ll easily get wifi in town, forget about in El Chalten. You may do your best by getting a local sim card; you may try hard to get online at your hostel, or when at a restaurant; and you may even be able to send the odd WhatApp message to your friends and upload a picture or two on social media if you are lucky.\nBut really, by all means don’t schedule work calls or business e-meetings:internet is frustratingly slow in most of Patagonia, and chances are you’ll end up wasting your time trying to communicate while really, you should be out on the trails.\n\nBut you’ll still need a power bank\n\nThe lack of internet will keep your phone battery going longer than it normally would. The constant use you’ll make of it to take incredible photos will consume it. Make sure to take a good power bank with you, so you can recharge your phone on the go any time your battery is running low. You wouldn’t want to run out of battery when you need to photograph that impressive mountain, right? \n\nYou should visit an estancia\n\nEstancias are farms used for cattle raising that can be found all over Argentina. Patagonia has some beautiful ones. Though some have now become actual tourist attractions where animal farming is only a minor part of the income, most of them are still fully working to raise the famous Argentinian beef and Patagonian lamb. A few of the latter ones are open to visitors. Try to find one of them, and make sure to visit. It’s a great way to learn more about the local culture and way of life, and about the hardship of living in Patagonia in the winter.\n\nYou do need hiking boots\n\nHiking boots are a must when traveling to Patagonia. You simply can’t head out on the trails with a pair of running shoes: you need something that gives you excellent ankle support, and that is water proof. If you are getting new boots, make sure to use them a few times before your trip and wear them in, so that they will be more comfortable.\n\nAnd socks\n\nMake sure you also don’t underestimate the importance of good hiking socks: they will keep your feet from rubbing against the shoes and blistering.\n\nIn fact, you do need proper hiking gear\n\nPacking smartly is essential when traveling to Patagonia. Leave your fancy clothes at home, and only bring good hiking gear that keeps you warm and at the same time comfortable.\n\nYou should bring a water bottle\n\nWater in Patagonia comes from glaciers and it’s absolutely safe to drink. Local authorities put a lot of effort in educating people to avoid practices that may cause contamination of rivers, streams and water sources and for the most part, you can easily refill your bottle at the river and avoid the use of plastic.\nOn occasions, campers and travelers doing things such as washing their clothes or even something as simple as swimming or rinsing their bowls in the river have caused contamination with serious consequences for people drinking the water. \nBy all means, avoid any kind of behavior that may cause contamination of the water: no swimming, washing dishes or clothes in the river!  \n \nYou should always wear sunglasses\n\nSunglasses are a basic commodity in Patagonia. They will protect you from the sun, but most importantly repair your eyes from the ever blowing winds and from all the dust that these carry. Make sure to always keep a pair in your bag!\n\nAnd a hat or a beanie\n\nMake sure to pack a hat and \u002F or a beanie for your Patagonia trip. You should go for something that protects you from the sun so – ideally – covers your forehead, and at the same time keeps your ears and head warm when it gets windy. You may not look stylish, but Patagonia ain’t a cat walk either.\n\nRemember to put on sun block \n\nNever underestimate the importance of sun block when traveling to Patagonia. Make sure to smother it on your face, neck, ears, chest and any other exposed bit. You won’t feel the sun so much, because it never gets too hot, but your skin definitely will and it will thank you if you protect it!\n\nCalafate berries are yummy\n\nEl Calafate, the main starting point to visit Perito Moreno Glacier takes its name from a berry that grows in a small bush and that can be found all over Patagonia. You will see these bushes along the trails and can safely eat the berries. Mind you, they are so tiny that there hardly is a chance you’ll fill up on them! But an old saying goes: “Once you taste the calafate berry, you are destined to go back to Patagonia.” I guess I called it upon me…\n\nActually, all food is good\n\nSpeaking of food, you’ll be glad to know that during your Patagonia trip you are likely to have some really good food. Whether you opt for the typical asado (mixed grill) or go for the local trucha (trout), the ever-present milanesa(breaded and fried meat) or the home made pasta or lamb ravioli; you can rest assured that you’ll be having delicious food throughout.\n\nAnd beer\n\nArgentina and Chile are both famous for their wine, but while this will be ever present on any good restaurant menu, Patagonia is not a wine producing region. What abounds locally, however, is beer. In recent year microbreweries have been springing pretty much anywhere, and you’ll be able to reward yourself with a good pint of craft beer after any hike. El Chalten has a lot of small breweries (which is surprising for such a small village). In Ushuaia, head to The Birra and opt for a good pint of Beagle.\n\nPatagonia is safe\n\nArgentina and Chile are the safest countries in South America, and Patagonia is by far the safest region. You can travel to Patagonia safely, even by yourself. Chances are you’ll be meeting lots of other like minded travelers, and enjoy a chat or two with the very friendly locals.\n\nYes, you do need a good travel insurance\n\nRegardless of how safe Patagonia is, of how fit you are for hiking, make sure to get yourself a good insurance before traveling to Patagonia. Some parts of it are truly remote, and in the unlucky event that something happens to you, you may have to be evacuated and this is very expensive.",

"For centuries, South America’s Amazon rainforest has provided a rich hunting ground for indigenous tribes, who don’t cultivate large quantities of fruits and vegetables.
